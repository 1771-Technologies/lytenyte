  <h3>
    The Fastest React Data Grid On The Modern Web
  </h3>

</div>
<div align="center">

LyteNyte Grid is a **~40 KB, zero-dependency React data grid** engineered for
high performance and enterprise-scale datasets. It can handle **10,000 updates/sec**
and render **millions of rows**. No wrappers. No heavy abstractions.

Choose between **headless** components or a **pre-styled** grid out of
the box, and ship faster with a **declarative API** that
is purpose-built for React.

Start with **LyteNyte Grid Core** (free and open source). Upgrade
to **LyteNyte Grid PRO** for advanced enterprise features and support.

LyteNyte Grid is available in two editions:

1. **LyteNyte Grid Core: Free, open-source edition** for building high-performance data tables.
   Includes sorting, filtering, editing, row selection, detail views, and more. Also includes advanced
   features such as aggregation, row grouping, and data export, often locked behind paywalls in other grids.

2. **LyteNyte Grid PRO: Commercial edition** that extends Core with powerful enterprise
   features such as server-side data loading, pivoting, tree data, component managers,
   and advanced filtering. Build custom menus, popovers and dialogs,
   and workflow-driven UIs with ease.

## Key Design Principles

- **Performance-First:** LyteNyte Grid is engineered with speed as a fundamental
  priority, ensuring responsive performance even when handling large datasets.

- **Modern Architecture:** Leveraging cutting-edge web technologies, LyteNyte
  Grid utilizes native browser scroll functionality to keep the main
  thread unencumbered as users navigate through their data.

- **React-Aligned Philosophy:** Adhering to React's core principles, LyteNyte Grid
  implements one-way data binding and declarative rendering to
  maintain predictable state management.
