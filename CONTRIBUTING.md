# Contributing to LyteNyte Grid

Thank you for your interest in LyteNyte Grid. At this time, we are not accepting external code contributions.

## Current Status

The LyteNyte Grid public interface is stable, but the internal workings are currently
in flux with a focus on improving code tools and module structures.
Things are changing quickly, and until we hit version 1.0,
we've decided not to accept external contributions.

## How You Can Help

You can still contribute in other ways:

- Create bug reports.
- Provide feedback on LyteNyte Grid.
- Suggest improvements to documentation.

## Future Contributions

Once we reach version 1.0, we plan to open up the project
for external contributions. We'll update this guide when that happens.

Sincerely,  
The 1771 Technologies Team
