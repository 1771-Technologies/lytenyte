title: Row Selection
description:
  Configure and manage single and multiple row selection in LyteNyte Grid with checkboxes, click
  interactions, and programmatic control.
---

LyteNyte Grid supports flexible row selection, including single and multiple selection modes. Users
can select rows through clicks, checkboxes, or both.

## Enable Row Selection

Set the `rowSelectionMode` property to `"single"` or `"multiple"`. To enable click-based selection,
set `rowSelectionActivator` to `"single-click"` or `"double-click"`.

!demo:Enabling Row Selection="./demos/row-selection"

### Multiple Row Selection

Set `rowSelectionMode` to `"multiple"` to allow selecting multiple rows. Clicking a row toggles its
selection. Hold **Shift** and click another row to select the range between it and the last selected
row.

!demo:Multiple Row Selection="./demos/row-selection-multi"

## Row Selection with Group Rows

Group rows create hierarchical relationships with their child rows. Control whether selecting a
group row also selects its children with the `rowSelectChildren` property.

!demo:Row Selection Group Selection="./demos/row-selection-groups"

## Checkbox Selection

When combining selection with group toggle buttons, stop event propagation to avoid triggering both
actions. Alternatively, set selection to `"double-click"` or implement your own checkbox selection
logic.

!demo:Row Selection Checkbox="./demos/row-selection-checkbox"

Use `grid.api.rowHandleSelect` to simplify selection handling in components. This method supports
shift-based range selection out of the box.

```tsx
<input
  type="checkbox"
  checked={rowSelected}
  onChange={() => {}}
  onClick={(e) => {
    grid.api.rowHandleSelect({
      target: e.currentTarget,
      shiftKey: e.shiftKey,
    });
  }}
/>
```

Attach the selection logic to the `onClick` event to easily detect **Shift** key presses.

## Prevent Row Selection

To block selection for certain rows, listen for the `rowSelectBegin` event and call
`preventDefault()`. In the example below, odd-numbered rows cannot be selected.  
See the [event guide](/docs/grid-events) for more on handling grid events.
