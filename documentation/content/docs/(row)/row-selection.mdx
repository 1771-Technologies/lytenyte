## Enabling Row Selection

The `rowSelectionMode` property on the LyteNyte grid state object may be used to configure the
row selection functionality the grid will support. It accepts one of the following values:

- `"none"`: Completely disables row selection in the grid, preventing any user action from selecting rows.
  Rows may still be selected programmatically by the developer.
- `"single"`: Allows the user to select a single row. When a row is selected, all other selected rows will be
  removed from the selection.
- `"multiple"`: Allows multiple rows to be selected, with support for additively adding rows to the current row
  selection.

In addition to the `rowSelectionMode`, the `rowSelectionActivator` on the grid state may be used to control the
action that user should perform on a row to select it. It accepts one of the following values:

- `"none"`: Disabled all selection actions. It will be up to the developer to provide a way for users to select rows,
  for example, using selection checkboxes.
- `"single-click"`: Will select a row when a user clicks the row.
- `"double-click"`: A row will be selected by the user if the user double clicks the row.

Using the properties above the demo demonstrates single row selection using a single click to select rows.
Different properties may be used to augment the way rows selected in the grid. Other sections in this guide
will cover multiple row selection and checkbox selection.

### Multiple Row Selection

Set `rowSelectionMode` to `"multiple"` to allow selecting multiple rows. Clicking a row toggles its
selection. Hold **Shift** and click another row to select the range between it and the last selected
row. The demo below demonstrates all of this in action.

!demo:Multiple Row Selection="./demos/row-selection-multi_x"

The code to configure this row selection is shown below. The important configuration is setting the
`rowSelectionMode` to `"multiple"`.

```ts
const grid = Grid.useLyteNyte({
  // Other grid props
  rowSelectionMode: "multiple",
  rowSelectionActivator: "single-click",
});
```

## Checkbox Selection

Selecting rows on click often conflicts with other grid interaction capabilities, or it may not conform
to common design patterns that users are familiar with. A familiar pattern for row selection is using
checkboxes that the user may click to select a row. This pattern is so common that LyteNyte Grid
provides the `api.rowHandleSelect` method to simplify selection logic, including shift-select behavior.

!demo:Checkbox Row Selection="./demos/row-selection-checkbox_x"

The demo uses `api.rowHandleSelect` to manage checkbox interactions:

```tsx
<GridCheckbox
  onClick={(ev) => {
    ev.stopPropagation();
    grid.api.rowHandleSelect({ shiftKey: ev.shiftKey, target: ev.target });
  }}
  onKeyDown={(ev) => {
    if (ev.key === "Enter" || ev.key === " ")
      grid.api.rowHandleSelect({ shiftKey: ev.shiftKey, target: ev.target });
  }}
/>
```

### Selecting All Rows

The checkbox demo allows for all the rows to be selected by clicking the checkbox in the header. This
is made possible using the [`grid.api.rowSelectAll`](/docs/reference/grid-api#gridapi) method on the grid
API. This method can be used to select or deselect all the rows in the grid.

## Group Row Selection

Row groups create a hierarchical relationships with their child rows, however, the group row is
a distinct row from its children, and has its own selection state. By default selecting a group row
will not select its children. This behavior can be changed using the `rowSelectChildren` property
on the grid's state. In the example below, selecting a group will select its children as well.

!demo:Row Selection Group Selection="./demos/row-selection-groups_x"

## Row Selection State

The `rowSelectionIds` property on the grid controls which rows are considered selected. It is a
set of string values where each value corresponds to a row ID. Not every value in the `rowSelectionIds`
set must be a valid row in the grid. This allows for rows that have not been created to be pre-selected
ahead of time. The example below demonstrates initially selecting rows by providing the a set of initial
ids.

!demo:Row Selection State="./demos/row-selection-state_x"

## Preventing Row Selection

When a row is selected, LyteNyte Grid will fire the `rowSelectBegin` event. This event
may be used to prevent a specific row from being selected. In the example below, the selection
of any odd-numbered rows is disallowed using this event.

!demo:Prevent Row Selection="./demos/row-selection-preventing_x"

The code to prevent the row selection is shown below. For more details on grid events
see the [Grid Events guide](/docs/grid-events).

```tsx
<Grid.Root
  grid={grid}
  onRowSelectBegin={({ preventDefault, selected }) => {
    if (Number.parseInt(selected) % 2) {
      preventDefault();
      alert(`Selection of the row at index ${Number.parseInt(selected)} has been prevent.`);
    }
  }}
>
  {/* other parts */}
</Grid.Root>
```

- [Row Full Width](/docs/row-full-width): Create rows the expand the full width of the viewport.
- [Row Grouping & Aggregation](/docs/row-grouping-and-aggregation): Group and aggregate rows to form hierarchical relationships.
- [Row Detail](/docs/row-detail): Provide auxiliary row components or nested grids in expandable row detail accordions.
