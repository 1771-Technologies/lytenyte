title: Row Sorting
description: LyteNyte Grid rows may be sorted in ascending or descending order. Use the grid's sort
  model to declaratively describe the sort state and the grid will display sorted rows.

## Sort Model

LyteNyte Grid sorts rows based on the `sortModel` property in grid state. The row data source you set
on the grid performs the actual sorting. The `sortModel` is an array of sort configurations.
LyteNyte Grid supports standard sort types and the ability to set a custom sort.

The [`SortModelItem`](/docs/reference/sort#sortmodelitem) describes the type interface of the each item
in the `sortModel`. An example is shown below:

```tsx
{ columnId: "age", sort: { kind: "number" }, isDescending: false },
```

This guide covers the sort model as a generic way to represent grid sorts, however the data source provided is
responsible for actually sorting the rows. The demo below demonstrates this is action using
the [Client Row Data Source](/docs/row-client-data-source). Checkout the
[Server Row Sorting guide](/docs/server-data-loading-row-sorting) for an example that sorts data on a mock server
before returning the sorted rows to the client.

To sort rows on the demo below, click the header cell, which will result in cycling through the sorts.

## Multi-Column Sort

Since `sortModel` is an array, you can define multiple sort rules. This creates a multi-way sort:

1. The first item in the array takes priority.
2. If values are equal, the next sort rule is applied, and so on.

In the example below hold **Ctrl** (Windows/Linux) or **Command** (macOS) when clicking a header
to add it to the sorting list. See the `Header` component in the
example for one way to implement this functionality.

If header clicks are reserved for another action or feel unintuitive, use the
[Sort Manager](/docs/component-sort-manager) component for a dedicated multi-sort UI.
