title: Row Sorting
description:
  Configure and control row sorting in LyteNyte Grid using sort models, column configurations, and
  programmatic API methods.
---

LyteNyte Grid sorts rows based on the `sortModel` property in grid state. The row data source you set
on the grid performs the actual sorting.

## Sort Model

The `sortModel` is an array of sort configurations. LyteNyte Grid supports three standard sort types and
one custom type.

Example:

```tsx
{ columnId: "age", sort: { kind: "number" }, isDescending: false },
```

Each sort configuration includes:

- **`columnId`** - The column to sort.
- **`sort.kind`** - The sort type:
  - `"number"`
  - `"string"`
  - `"date"`
  - `"custom"` - Requires a custom comparator function.
- **`isDescending`** - Boolean indicating sort direction.

## Multi-Column Sort

Because `sortModel` is an array, you can define multiple sort rules. This creates a multi-way sort:

1. The first item in the array takes priority.
2. If values are equal, the next sort rule is applied, and so on.

In the example below hold **Ctrl** (Windows/Linux) or **Command** (macOS) when clicking a header
to add it to the sorting list. See the `Header` component in the
example for one way to implement this.

If header clicks are reserved for another action or feel unintuitive, use the
[Sort Manager](/docs/component-sort-manager) component for a dedicated multi-sort UI.
