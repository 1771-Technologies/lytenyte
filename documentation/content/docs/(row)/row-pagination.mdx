title: Row Pagination
description:
  Implement and configure row pagination in LyteNyte Grid to divide large datasets into manageable
  pages with customizable page sizes and navigation controls.
---

LyteNyte Grid lets you split large datasets into pages, making them easier to navigate. Row
pagination uses the `useClientRowDataSourcePaginated` row data source.

## Use Row Pagination

Provide LyteNyte Grid with a data source created by `useClientRowDataSourcePaginated` to enable
pagination. This data source adds `page` properties you can use to control the current page and set
the page size.

!demo:Row Pagination="./demos/row-pagination"

### Set Page Size

Control how many rows appear per page with the `perPage` property on the data source. LyteNyte Grid
uses this value and the total row count to calculate the total number of pages.

```tsx
const ds = useClientRowDataSourcePaginated({
  data: bankDataSmall,
  rowsPerPage: 20,
});

ds.page.perPage.set(40);
```

### Change the Current Page

Use the `current` property on `ds.page` to get or set the current page. As a grid state property, it
can be used reactively in your application.

```tsx
const ds = useClientRowDataSourcePaginated({
  data: bankDataSmall,
  rowsPerPage: 20,
});

ds.page.current.set(3);
```
