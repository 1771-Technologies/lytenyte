title: Rows Overview
description: LyteNyte Grid has two types of rows, group rows and leaf rows. These rows are used
  to create the main content displayed by the grid.
---

## Row Node Interface

The rows in the LyteNyte Grid are represented by the [`RowNode` interface](/docs/reference/row#rownode). This
interface is a type union of two types:

- [`RowLeaf`](/docs/reference/row#rowleaf): A row in the grid that does not have an children rows.
- [`RowGroup`](/docs/refernce/row#rowgroup): A row with children rows. The group row creates a hierarchical relationship
  among rows.

You can distinguish between the row node types by using the `kind` property on the interfaces. For example:

```ts
const row: RowNode = { ... };

const isLeaf = row.kind === "leaf"
const isGroup = row.kind === "branch"
```

LyteNyte Grid's API provides a convenience methods to make distinguishing row node types straightforward.
The code below demonstrates these methods in action. If you are using TypeScript, these methods will also
narrow the row node type union:

```ts
const isLeaf = grid.api.rowIsLeaf(row);
const isGroup = grid.api.rowIsGroup(row);
```

## Row Indices

If you carefully inspect the `RowNode` interface you will notice that there is no **row index** property.
At first glance this seems strange, however, it important to understand that a row node does not necessarily
have to be displayed in the grid. Row nodes are created by the provided grid data source, and some data
sources (like the [Server Data Source](/docs/server-data-loading-overview)) are capable of returning rows
that have not yet been displayed to the user. Such rows will not have defined row index.

The lack of row index on the `RowNode` interface does not mean it is impossible to get the row index for a given
row. Where the row index is available, LyteNyte Grid will provide it as a prop to components or callbacks. For example,
the cell renderers are given the `rowIndex` property, as the marker column example demonstrates:

!demo:Marker Column Row Index Display="../(column)/demos/column-marker_x"

Notice how the row index value is displayed in the marker column for each row. The marker column's cell renderer
is shown below. The `rowIndex` property is available on the props provided by LyteNyte Grid. Furthermore, the
renderer adds 1 to the row index, since LyteNyte Grid starts counting rows at 0.

```tsx
const cellRenderer = (p) => {
  return <div>{p.rowIndex + 1}</div>;
};
```

## Other Row State

The `RowNode` interface represents individual rows, but it does not contain layout information. For
example, the pin state of a row is maintained separately in the grid state as part of grid view.
The example below demonstrates this in action:

!demo:Row Pinning="./demos/row-pinning_x"

In the demo, the pin state of the row is kept in the `view` property of the grid state. You can see
this in the code responsible for rendering the top section:

```tsx
<Grid.RowsTop>
  {view.rows.top.map((row) => {
    // Render logic
  })}
</Grid.RowsTop>
```

In addition to pin state the following information is not maintained on the row node:

- Row height
- Row detail expansion
- Row full width predicate
- Row selection state

The remaining guides in the Rows section will cover each aspect of the rows in the grid.

## Next Steps

- [Row Height](/docs/row-height): Learn how to change the height of rows, how to handle variable height rows and fill height rows.
- [Row Pinning](/docs/row-pinning): See how to freeze specific rows to the top and bottom of the grid's viewport.
- [Row Selection](/docs/row-selection): Select individual and multiple rows.
- [Row Detail](/docs/row-detail): Provide auxiliary row components or nested grids in expandable row detail accordions.
