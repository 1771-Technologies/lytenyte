  Learn about row dragging in LyteNyte Grid, with support for external drop zones and multiple row
  dragging.

LyteNyte Grid provides flexible row dragging that lets users move data through intuitive
drag-and-drop interactions. You can drag single or multiple rows within a grid, across multiple
grids, or into external drop zones. The grid supplies the mechanics without enforcing default
behavior, so you control how drag interactions are handled.

## Single Row Dragging

Use the `grid.api.useRowDrag` hook to add row dragging. This hook returns drag props that you attach
to a drag handle component. It expects a `getDragData` callback, which must return the drag data in
the following shape:

```tsx
export interface DragData {
  readonly siteLocalData?: Record<string, any>;
  readonly dataTransfer?: Record<string, string>;
}
```

Drop zones must declare which drag data keys they accept. For example, the `Row` component is a
dropzone. Set its `accepted` property to specify what it will accept.

The example below shows a basic setup. Pay attention to the marker column's `cellRenderer` and the
`accepted` prop on `Grid.Row`.

## Dragging Multiple Rows

Extend row dragging to multiple rows by combining it with Row Selection. Instead of dragging a single
row, you query the selection state in `getDragData` to include all selected rows.

## Dragging Between Grids

To drag between grids, use a shared `accepted` value. For example, setting `accepted=["row"]` on both
grids allows any drag data with a `row` property to be dropped onto rows in either grid.

## External Drop Zones

LyteNyte Grid provides a `DropWrap` component for external drop zones. `DropWrap` is a simple `div`
that handles all the necessary drag events and can accept any drag data produced by the grid.
