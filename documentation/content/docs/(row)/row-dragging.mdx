title: Row Dragging
description: LyteNyte Grid supports row dragging. Rows may be dragged within the same grid, to other
  grids, or to an external drop area.

## Single Row Dragging

LyteNyte Grid's row dragging capabilities are hook based.
Use the `grid.api.useRowDrag` hook to add row dragging. This hook returns drag props that you attach
to a drag handle component. It expects a `getDragData` callback, which must return the drag data in
the following shape:

```tsx
export interface DragData {
  readonly siteLocalData?: Record<string, any>;
  readonly dataTransfer?: Record<string, string>;
}
```

Drop zones must declare which drag data keys they accept. For example, the `Row` component is a
dropzone. Set its `accepted` property to specify what it will accept. In the example below, the
basic single row drag setup is shown. Pay attention to the marker column's `cellRenderer` and the
`accepted` prop on `Grid.Row`.

## Dragging Multiple Rows

Extend row dragging to multiple rows by combining it with Row Selection. Instead of dragging a single
row, you query the selection state in `getDragData` to include all selected rows.

## Dragging Between Grids

To drag between grids, use a shared `accepted` value. For example, setting `accepted=["row"]` on both
grids allows any drag data with a `row` property to be dropped onto rows in either grid.

## External Drop Zones

LyteNyte Grid provides a `DropWrap` component for external drop zones. `DropWrap` is a simple `div`
that handles all the necessary drag events and can accept any drag data produced by the grid.
