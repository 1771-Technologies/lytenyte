## Single Row Dragging

LyteNyte Grid implements row dragging through hooks. Use the `grid.api.useRowDrag` hook to enable row
dragging. This hook returns drag props that you attach to a drag handle component. It requires a
`getDragData` callback, which must return drag data in the following shape:

```tsx
export interface DragData {
  readonly siteLocalData?: Record<string, any>;
  readonly dataTransfer?: Record<string, string>;
}
```

Drop zones must declare which drag data keys they accept. For example, the `Row` component acts as a
drop zone. Set its `accepted` property to define which drag data it can receive. The demo below shows
a basic single-row drag setup. Focus on the marker column's `cellRenderer` and the `accepted` prop on
`Grid.Row`.

## Dragging Multiple Rows

Combine row dragging with **row selection** to support dragging multiple rows. Instead of returning data
for a single row, use `getDragData` to include all selected rows from the selection state.

## Dragging Between Grids

To enable dragging between grids, use a shared `accepted` value. For example, setting
`accepted={["row"]}` on both grids allows drag data containing a `row` key to be dropped onto rows in
either grid.

## External Drop Zones

Use the `DropWrap` component to create external drop zones. `DropWrap` renders a `div` that handles
all required drag events and can accept any drag data produced by the grid.
