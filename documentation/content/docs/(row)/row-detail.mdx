## Using Row Detail

Row detail functionality in LyteNyte Grid is always enabled. Any row may have a row detail section.
To create a detail section start by defining a `rowDetailRenderer` on the grid state object. This
renderer will be used by LyteNyte Grid for displaying the content of a row's detail area.

With a detail renderer defined, setting the `rowDetailExpansions` set on the grid state will result
in rows displaying their detail area. The `rowDetailExpansions` property is a set of row IDs for which
to display their detail sections.

The demo below demonstrates this in action. The [marker column](/docs/marker-column) is used to render
a detail toggle. The detail toggle uses the `grid.api.rowDetailToggle` method which will toggle the membership
of a given row in the `rowDetailExpansions` set.

## Auto Row Detail Height

The `rowDetailHeight` may be used to control the height of the detail section. The `rowDetailHeight`
value may be:

- **Number**: A fixed height in pixels that the detail section will be.
- **Auto**: The string value `"auto"` which results in the content of the detail determining its height.

By default a number value is used, however, `"auto"` is useful in cases where the content of the detail
area should determine its height.

## Nested Grids

One common use case for row detail areas so for nested grid or tables. There is a master grid, and expanding
the detail area reveals a child grid. LyteNyte Grid can be nested inside a detail area, which results in a
nested grids. The demo below demonstrates this in action:

!demo:Nested Grids="./demos/row-detail-nested_x"

As the demo demonstrates, a nested grid isn't a special case of the detail renderer. To create a nested
grid the detail renderer should render another grid. LyteNyte gives the developer full flexibility as to
what should be displayed in the detail area of a row.
