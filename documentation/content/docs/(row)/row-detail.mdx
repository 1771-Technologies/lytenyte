title: Row Detail
description: Create expandable detail sections beneath rows in LyteNyte Grid with customizable React
  components, expansion controls, and programmatic API methods.
---

LyteNyte Grid lets you add expandable detail sections beneath individual rows.
This feature, called **Row Detail** (also known as Master Detail),
lets you render any React component in the expanded area.

## Enable Row Detail

Expand a row's detail area by adding its `id` to the `rowDetailExpansions`
state in LyteNyte Grid. This enables expansion for specific rows.
Provide a React component through the `rowDetailRenderer` property
to define the content in each row's detail section.

!demo:Row Detail="./demos/row-detail"

### Set Row Detail Height

Control the detail area's height with the `rowDetailHeight`
property. Specify a fixed pixel value or use the
string `"auto"` to return a calculated pixel height.

!demo:Row Detail Height="./demos/row-detail-height"

### Add a Row Detail Marker

By default, LyteNyte Grid does not include a built-in component
for expanding or collapsing a row's detail area. Use the
`api.rowDetailToggle` method to toggle or set a row's expansion state.
A common approach is to use LyteNyte Grid's marker column as the toggle control.

Example:

!demo:Row Detail Marker="./demos/row-detail-marker"

## Manage Row Detail Expansions

The `rowDetailExpansions` property in grid state stores
the ids of expanded rows. Update this value programmatically
to change which rows show their detail sections.

Use these LyteNyte Grid API methods to control row detail programmatically:

- `rowDetailIsExpanded` - Returns `true` if a row is expanded.
- `rowDetailToggle` - Switches a row's expansion state.
- `rowDetailRenderedHeight` - Returns the current visible height (in pixels) of a row's detail section.

See the [API Reference](/docs/reference/overview) for complete details.
