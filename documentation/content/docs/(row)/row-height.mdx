title: Row Height
description: LyteNyte Grid lets developers control row height. Rows can use a fixed height,
  vary height per row, or expand to fill the available viewport space.
---

The `rowHeight` property on the grid state controls how LyteNyte Grid calculates the
height, in pixels, for each row. This property accepts one of three values:

- **Number:** Sets all rows to a fixed height in pixels.
- **Function:** Returns the height in pixels for each row. Use this option to create variable row heights.
- **Fill String:** A string of the form `fill:<number>`. For example, `fill:24` instructs LyteNyte Grid
  to distribute the available viewport space across all rows, while enforcing a minimum height of `24px` per row.

## Number Row Heights

Set `rowHeight` to a number to give all rows a uniform height. The numeric value
represents the row height in pixels. The demo below shows fixed row heights in action.

### Updating Row Height

In the demo above, clicking the toggle buttons updates the row height.
You can change the row height by setting the `grid.state.rowHeight` property.
Updating this value causes the grid to recalculate row layout,
so avoid changing it inside hot or frequently running code paths.

The following example sets the row height to `40px`:

```ts
grid.state.rowHeight.set(40);
```

If you need to update a **variable** row height after grid initialization, set `rowHeight` to a function
that **returns** your height function. This pattern prevents you from overwriting
the state setter with the height function itself.

```ts
const myRowHeightFunction = (i: number) => {
  /* implementation */
};

// ❌ Incorrect
grid.state.rowHeight.set(myRowHeightFunction);

// ✅ Correct
grid.state.rowHeight.set(() => myRowHeightFunction);
```

## Variable Row Height

LyteNyte Grid supports variable row heights through a function callback.
This function must return a number representing the row height in pixels,
and the returned value may differ per row.

LyteNyte Grid calls this function for every row during layout, so performance is critical.
Keep the implementation simple and avoid expensive calculations inside the callback.

The demo below illustrates variable row heights in practice.

!demo:Variable Row Height="./demos/row-height-variable_x"

In this example, the row height cycles through a predefined set of values.
While this demo uses a simple pattern, your own logic can be as complex as needed,
as long as it remains performant.

```ts
const grid = Grid.useLyteNyte({
  // Other grid properties
  rowHeight: (i) => [30, 50, 80, 120][i % 4],
});
```

## Fill Row Height

Use the fill row height syntax `"fill:<n>"` to make rows expand and fill
the available viewport space, where `n` is the minimum row height in pixels.

LyteNyte Grid assigns each row its minimum height, calculates the remaining available space,
and then distributes that space evenly across all rows. This approach works well when the
grid displays only a small number of rows and you want them to occupy the full viewport height.

!demo:Fill Row Height="./demos/row-height-fill_x"

<Callout>

When using fill row heights, if the combined minimum height of all rows exceeds the viewport height,
the grid cannot distribute additional space. In this case, each row renders at exactly
its minimum height, behaving the same as fixed-height rows.
