description: Configure fixed, variable, and fill row heights in LyteNyte Grid for flexible layouts.

LyteNyte Grid lets you control row heights to create compact or spacious layouts. Use the
`rowHeight` property to set row height in pixels. You can assign a fixed value or a function that
calculates height for each row.

## Fixed Row Height

Set `rowHeight` to a number to give all rows a uniform height.

!demo:Row Height Fixed="./demos/row-height-fixed"

Update row height dynamically after initialization by changing the `rowHeight` state property:

```ts
grid.state.rowHeight.set(40); // Set all rows to 40px
```

## Variable Row Height

Pass a function to `rowHeight` to define different heights per row. LyteNyte Grid calls this
function for each row to determine its height, then calculates the total scrollable height for the
grid.

When updating a variable row height after initialization, set `rowHeight` to a function that returns
your height function. This avoids overwriting the setter with your function directly.

```ts
const myRowHeightFunction = (i: number) => {
  /* implementation */
};

// ✅ Correct
grid.state.rowHeight.set(() => myRowHeightFunction);

// ❌ Incorrect
grid.state.rowHeight.set(myRowHeightFunction);
```

## Fill Row Height

Use the fill row height syntax `"fill:<n>"` to make rows expand and fill available space, where `n`
is the minimum row height in pixels. LyteNyte Grid assigns each row its minimum height, calculates
remaining space, and distributes it evenly among all rows. This is useful for grids with few visible
rows or in paginated views.
