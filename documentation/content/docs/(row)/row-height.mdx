title: Row Height
description:
  LyteNyte Grid lets developers control the height of rows in the grid. All rows may have the
  same height, variable height, or grow to fill the available space.
---

The `rowHeight` property on the grid state controls how LyteNyte Grid should calculate the height
in pixels for individual rows. The property accepts one of three values:

- **Number:** Sets the height of rows to a fixed pixel value.
- **Function:** A function that will return the height in pixels on a per row basis. Use function values to
  create variable row heights.
- **Fill String:** A string value of the form `fill:<number>`. For example `fill:24`, this instructs LyteNyte Grid to distribute
  the available viewport space among the rows with a minimum height of `24px` per row.

## Number Row Heights

Set `rowHeight` to a number to give all rows a uniform height. The number provided to the `rowHeight`
represents the height in pixels. The demo below demonstrates fixed rows heights in action.

!demo:Fixed Row Height="./demos/row-height-fixed_x"

### Updating Row Height

In the demo above, the row height is changed by clicking the different toggle group buttons.
Updating the row height can be done by setting the `grid.state.rowHeight` property. Setting this property
results in the grid recalculating the row layout hence, hence avoid setting the row height state in hot loops.
The code below shows how to change the row height to `40px`.

```ts
grid.state.rowHeight.set(40);
```

When updating a variable row height after initialization, set `rowHeight` to a function that returns
your height function. This avoids overwriting the setter with your function directly.

```ts
const myRowHeightFunction = (i: number) => {
  /* implementation */
};

// ❌ Incorrect
grid.state.rowHeight.set(myRowHeightFunction);

// ✅ Correct
grid.state.rowHeight.set(() => myRowHeightFunction);
```

## Variable Row Height

LyteNyte Grid supports variable row height using a function callback. The function provided should
return a number, however the value returned may differ on a per row basis. Since LyteNyte Grid will
call this function for each row, its important that the function is extremely performant. Avoid performing
any costly calculations in the provided callback. The demo below demonstrates variable row heights in
action.

!demo:Variable Row Height="./demos/row-height-variable_x"

In the demo the row height is calculating as a simple repeating array of heights. The code for this is
shown below. However, your own row height calculations can be as complex as you desire.

```ts
const grid = Grid.useLyteNyte({
  // Other grid properties
  rowHeight: (i) => [30, 50, 80, 120][i % 4],
});
```

## Fill Row Height

Use the fill row height syntax `"fill:<n>"` to make rows expand and fill available space, where `n`
is the minimum row height in pixels. LyteNyte Grid assigns each row its minimum height, calculates
remaining space, and distributes it evenly among all rows. This is useful in cases where only a few
rows are displayed in the grid.

<Callout>

When using row height fills, if the minimum total row height exceeds the height of the viewport then
the row height will behave similar to fixed row heights, with each row taking exactly the minimum
height specified. This is because fill row heights distribute available free space, however, when the
rows exceed the viewport height, the available free space is 0.
