description: Fix rows at the top or bottom of LyteNyte Grid to keep key information visible while
  scrolling.

LyteNyte Grid lets you pin rows to the top or bottom of the viewport so they remain visible while
scrolling. Use pinned rows to highlight important data, keep headers in view, or display summary
information.

## Set Pinned Rows

Pinned rows are defined by your configured `rowDataSource`. The method for specifying pinned rows
depends on the row data source type. The example below uses the client row data source.
