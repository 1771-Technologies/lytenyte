## Pinned Row Elements

Pinned rows occupy a different section in the `Grid.RowsContainer` than scrollable rows. When using
pinned rows be sure to include the section elements, as show below. See
the [Headless Component Parts guide](/docs/grid-headless-parts) for more details.

```tsx
<Grid.RowsContainer>
  <Grid.RowsTop>
    {view.rows.top.map((row) => {
      // top rows here
    })}
  </Grid.RowsTop>

  <Grid.RowsCenter>
    {view.rows.center.map((row) => {
      // center rows here
    })}
  </Grid.RowsCenter>
  <Grid.RowsBottom>
    {view.rows.bottom.map((row) => {
      // bottom rows here
    })}
  </Grid.RowsBottom>
</Grid.RowsContainer>
```

## Pinned Row Example

Pinned rows are defined by the data source provided to the grid. The method for specifying pinned rows
depends on the row data source type. The demo below will use the
[Client Row Data Source](/docs/row-client-data-source) to demonstrate pinned rows. For other data source
see their dedicated guides:

- [Tree Data Source](/docs/row-tree-data-source)
- [Server Row Pinning](/docs/server-data-loading-row-pinning)

Regardless of the data source, the approach to displaying the pinned rows is the same. Rendering the
`Grid.RowsTops` and `Grid.RowsBottom` components will always display the pinned rows for a given view.

!demo:Pinned Rows="./demos/row-pinning_x"

## Pinned Row Indices

LyteNyte Grid starting counting rows from the top to the bottom. When the grid contains pinned rows, the
first row is considering the first top pinned row, and the last row is considered the last bottom pinned row.
This has one important consideration that developers should be aware of. When rows are pinned top the row
index of scrollable rows is offset by the number of rows pinned top. This mainly has implications when
working with rows by row index, for example when retrieving a row by its index developers should offset the
index by the top count if they want to retrieve the first scrollable row.

You can see this most clearly if use the marker column to display row indices, as the example below demonstrates:

!demo:Rows With Pinned Offset="./demos/row-pinning-marker_x"

Notice the first scrollable row has an index of 3 displayed. This is because rows 1 and 2 are pinned top. Furthermore,
the bottom rows have index 17 and 18, as the index for these rows is offset by the top and center rows.
