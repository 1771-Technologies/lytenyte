title: Row Full Width

  Create rows that span the entire grid viewport width in LyteNyte Grid, ideal for section
  headers, summary rows, or special content areas.

LyteNyte Grid lets you create rows that span the grid's
entire viewport width. These rows contain a single cell
instead of the standard one cell per column.

## Create Full Width Rows

Decide which rows should appear full width by setting
the `rowFullWidthPredicate` property in the grid state. Pass
a function to this property to determine which rows span the full width.

Because full width rows don't belong to any column, provide a
React component through the `rowFullWidthRenderer` property to render their content.

In the example below, note the use of the `Grid.RowFullWidth`
component to render full width rows. This component is required because
full width rows are a special row type.

Full width rows always span the grid's viewport width
and remain visible during horizontal scrolling. Use them for
section headers, summary rows, or specialized content areas within your grid.
