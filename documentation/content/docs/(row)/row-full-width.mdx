title: Row Full Width
description: LyteNyte Grid supports the ability to create full width rows. Full width rows
  will render a single grid cell that will have the same width as the viewport.
---

## Full Width Row Predicate

The `rowFullWidthPredicate` on the grid state is used by LyteNyte Grid to determine if a row should
be rendered as a full width row. A full width row will span the width of the viewport. Furthermore,
full width rows replace the existing row that would've otherwise been rendered in its position.

Full width rows always span the grid's viewport width and remain
visible during horizontal scrolling. Use them for
section headers, summary rows, or specialized content areas within your grid.

In the demo below, full width
rows are used to create sections by the exchange the crypto symbol trades on. This is one common
use case of full width rows.

!demo:Row Full Width="./demos/row-full-width_x"

The demo uses the `rowFullWidthRenderer` to provide LyteNyte Grid with a component to use for rendering
full width rows. This component may be any arbitrary React component. In the demo, the component renders
the exchange centered within the row, as the code below shows.

```tsx
export function FullWidthCell({
  grid: { api },
  row,
}: RowFullWidthRendererParams<DEXPerformanceData>) {
  if (!api.rowIsLeaf(row) || !row.data) return null;

  const name = row.data.exchange;
  const image = exchanges[name];

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <img src={image} alt={`Logo for exchange ${name}`} />
      </div>
      <div>{name}</div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Grid Full Width Component

LyteNyte Grid treats full width rows as a separate row type from the normal grid cell. When
rendering full width rows be sure to include handling for the full width component in the headless
component parts, as shown in the code below. For more on the individual component parts see our
[Headless Component Parts guide](/docs/grid-headless-parts).

```tsx
<Grid.RowsCenter>
  {view.rows.center.map((row) => {
    if (row.kind === "full-width") return <Grid.RowFullWidth row={row} />;

    return <Grid.Row row={row} key={row.id} />;
  })}
</Grid.RowsCenter>
```
