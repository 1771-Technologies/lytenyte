title: Row Full Width
description: Create full width rows in LyteNyte Grid that render a single cell spanning the entire viewport.

## Full Width Row Predicate

Use `rowFullWidthPredicate` on the grid state to determine whether a row renders as a full width row.
A full width row spans the entire viewport and replaces the standard row that would otherwise render
in the same position.

Full width rows always span the viewport and remain visible during horizontal scrolling. Use them for
section headers, summary rows, or other specialized content within the grid.

In the demo below, full width rows group data by the exchange on which each crypto symbol trades. This
pattern is a common use case for full width rows.

!demo:Full Width Rows="./demos/row-full-width_x"

The demo uses `rowFullWidthRenderer` to provide a React component for rendering full width rows. This
renderer can return any React component. In the demo, the component renders the exchange name and logo
centered within the row, as shown below.

```tsx
export function FullWidthCell({ grid: { api }, row }: RowFullWidthRendererParams<DEXPerformanceData>) {
  if (!api.rowIsLeaf(row) || !row.data) return null;

  const name = row.data.exchange;
  const image = exchanges[name];

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <img src={image} alt={`Logo for exchange \${name}`} />
      </div>
      <div>{name}</div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Full Width Row Component

LyteNyte Grid treats full width rows as a distinct row type. When rendering rows in a headless setup,
handle full width rows explicitly, as shown below. For details on the individual component parts, see
the [Headless Component Parts guide](/docs/grid-headless-parts).

```tsx
<Grid.RowsCenter>
  {view.rows.center.map((row) => {
    if (row.kind === "full-width") return <Grid.RowFullWidth row={row} />;

    return <Grid.Row row={row} key={row.id} />;
  })}
</Grid.RowsCenter>
```
