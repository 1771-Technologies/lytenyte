title: Column Quick Filter
description: Use quick filters in LyteNyte Grid to search multiple columns at once with a single text input.
---

A quick filter lets users search across multiple columns with a single text value. LyteNyte Grid
keeps rows where any eligible column matches the search term and hides all others.

## Apply a Quick Filter

Set the `quickSearch` value on the grid state to enable quick filtering. LyteNyte Grid will search
across all eligible columns using this value.

By default, every column is included in the search. This can be useful, but in grids with many
numeric columns, it may lead to unwanted matches. To exclude a column, set its `quickSearchIgnore`
property to `true`.

A common pattern is to set `quickSearchIgnore` in the base column definition, then selectively
enable quick search for specific columns. In the example below, only the `Job` and `Education`
columns are searchable.

## Control Case Sensitivity

Use the `quickSearchSensitivity` property on the grid to specify case sensitivity for quick search.
Set it to match your application's requirements-case sensitive or case insensitive.
