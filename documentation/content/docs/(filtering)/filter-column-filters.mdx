title: Column Filters
description: Filter data in LyteNyte Grid using text, number, date, combined, function filters, and more.
---

LyteNyte Grid lets you filter data by applying filters to individual columns. Use the `filterModel`
property on grid state to define which columns have filters applied.

The filter model is a key/value object:

- Each key is a column `id`.
- Each value is a filter configuration.

This section describes **simple filters**, available in both **Core** and **PRO** editions.  
The **PRO** edition also supports:

- [In Filters](/docs/filter-in-column-filter) - Set filters or tree-set filters.
- [Quick Filters](/docs/filter-quick-filter) - Quick search across multiple columns.

## Apply Column Filters

Set a filter in the `filterModel` to enable column-level filtering. Example:

```ts
const filterModel = {
  job: {
    kind: "text",
    operator: "contains",
    value: "tech",
  },
};
```

## Text Filter

Use text filters for columns with string values. Operators include `contains`, `begins_with`, and
others. Example: filter for rows where the `job` field contains `"tech"`.

!demo:Text Filter="./demos/filter-text"

## Number Filter

Apply number filters to numeric columns. Operators include `less_than`, `greater_than`, and `equal`.
Example: filter out all rows with `age < 30`.

!demo:Number Filter="./demos/filter-number"

## Date Filter

Use date filters for columns with date values. Operators include comparisons and date ranges, such
as filtering for a specific quarter.

<Callout>

Date filters require column values that can be parsed by the `Date` constructor.

</Callout>

Example: filter rows where the date falls in Q2.

!demo:Date Filter="./demos/filter-date"

## Combined Filter

Use a combined filter when multiple conditions need to be applied. A `combination` filter accepts an
array of filters and evaluates them using either `AND` or `OR`. It supports short-circuit
evaluation, stopping early if the outcome is already determined.

Example: filter for ages between 30 and 35.

!demo:Combined Filter="./demos/filter-combined"

## Function Filter

Function filters give you full control. Provide a custom predicate that returns `true` for rows to
keep and `false` for rows to exclude.

Example: filter out all rows with odd `age` values.

!demo:Function Filter="./demos/filter-function"
