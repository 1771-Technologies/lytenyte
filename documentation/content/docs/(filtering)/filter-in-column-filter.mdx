title: Column In Filter
description:
  Use in-filters (set filters or tree-set filters) in LyteNyte Grid to filter data by selecting
  values from a list or hierarchical structure.
---

An **in-filter** (also called a set filter or tree-set filter) lets users filter rows by selecting
specific values from a list. Define an in-filter for a column using the `filterInModel`, alongside
[standard column filters](/docs/filter-column-filters).

## Requirements

Your row data source must support in-filters because it provides the possible filter values.  
All built-in LyteNyte Grid row data sources support them.

## Example

Defining an in-filter on a model is straightforward:

```ts
const filterModel = {
  job: {
    kind: "in",
    operator: "in",
    value: new Set(["technician", "services"]),
  },
};
```

## Enhanced In-Filters

The basic in-filter is simple to apply, but its real power comes from UI components built around it.
LyteNyte Grid PRO includes the [Tree Filter](/docs/component-filter-tree) component, which lets you
present filter values as a flat list or a hierarchical tree for more advanced filtering.
