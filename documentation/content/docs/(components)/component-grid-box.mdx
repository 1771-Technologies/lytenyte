title: Grid Box
description: The LyteNyte Grid PRO library includes a versatile list component called GridBox.
  This component can be used to create both horizontal and vertical lists that integrate seamlessly with LyteNyte Grid.

## Usage

The `GridBox` component is highly flexible-it can power pill rows, list pickers, and many other interactive layouts.

In the example below, it's used as a **group pill manager**:

- Pills can be dragged and reordered.
- Groups can be added or removed by clicking the **`+` icon** on the right.
- Even the popover list relies on the same `GridBox` component.

## Default Hooks

LyteNyte Grid provides three built-in hooks that make it easy to generate lists for common use cases:

- **`GridBox.useAggregationBoxItems`** - Enumerates the grid's aggregation model,
  producing a list of applied aggregations.
- **`GridBox.useColumnBoxItems`** - Enumerates the grid's columns. Use this to
  build lists that manage column-related settings or behaviors.
- **`GridBox.useRowGroupBoxItems`** - Enumerates the row group model of the grid.
  This hook also supports drag-and-drop ordering for row groups.

These hooks are **convenience utilities**-they simplify setup but are not required
to use the `GridBox` component effectively.

## GridBox Structure

The `GridBox` component is composed of the following parts:

- **`Root`** - The root context of the grid box. All components must be rendered within `Root`.
- **`Panel`** - The main container that provides layout and keyboard interaction handling.
- **`Item`** - A single list item, serving as the primary interaction point.
