# Filter Tree

The Filter Tree component lets you update filters using a tree-based UI. It is especially useful for
columns with a limited set of values. A filter tree can be flat or hierarchical-the example below
shows both.

## Data Source and Items

The row data source supplies the items for the filter tree. Each item has the following shape:

```tsx
export interface FilterInFilterItem {
  readonly id: string;
  readonly label: string;
  readonly value: unknown;
  readonly groupPath?: string[];
}
```

LyteNyte Grid uses these items to construct the filter tree.

## Filter Tree Component Parts

The Filter Tree is composed of the following parts:

- **`Root`** - Provides the root context. All other parts must be rendered within `Root`.
- **`Panel`** - Container for filter items.
- **`Leaf`** - Represents a single filter option.
- **`Branch`** - Represents a nested group of filter items. Branches support additional overrideable
  slots:
  - `label` - Displays the branch label text.
  - `labelWrap` - Wraps the branch label element.
  - `expander` - Toggles the expand/collapse state of the branch.
- **`Label`** - Displays the label text for a filter item.
- **`Checkbox`** - Toggles the filter state of the item.

This structure allows you to mix flat and nested filter trees and override individual parts for
customized behavior and styling.
