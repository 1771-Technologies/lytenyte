  Learn how to implement and use dialog frames in LyteNyte Grid to create accessible modal
  interfaces in your grid applications.

LyteNyte Grid PRO lets you open popovers on demand, but leaves the actual UI to your chosen
component library. This prevents bundling multiple popover libraries into the same application.

## How It Works

Register a popover frame on the grid using the `popoverFrame` property. Open a popover with:

- `grid.api.popoverFrameOpen(id, target, context?)`. The popover frame with the given `id` will be opened.
  An optional context for that instance may be provided. The popover frame should be positioned by the `target` element.
- The `grid.api.popoverFrameClose(id?)` method will then close a popover frame with the given `id`.

LyteNyte Grid manages the popover state, while the developer is responsible for the rendering using their
provided library.

The example below uses the [popover component from Base UI](https://base-ui.com/react/components/popover)
to display popovers next to cells when they are clicked.

## Why Use the Grid's Popover Frame?

The key advantage is **context management**. Defining dialogs at the grid level means:

- You can open popovers directly from grid components (e.g., cell renderers) with the right context.
- You avoid building custom state management or using React Context for popover coordination.
- You focus on popover rendering while the grid handles orchestration.

This approach simplifies integration and ensures popovers work seamlessly with grid-level state and
interactions.
