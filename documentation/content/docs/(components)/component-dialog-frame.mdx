title: Dialog Frame
description:
  Implement and use dialog frames in LyteNyte Grid to create accessible modal interfaces in your
  grid applications.
---

LyteNyte Grid PRO lets you open dialogs on demand, but leaves the actual dialog UI to your chosen
component library. This prevents bundling multiple dialog libraries into the same application.

## How It Works

Register a dialog frame on the grid using the `dialogFrames` property.  
Open a dialog with:

- `grid.api.dialogFrameOpen(id, context?)` - Opens the dialog frame with the given `id` and optional
  context for that instance.

Close a dialog with:

- `grid.api.dialogFrameClose(id?)` - Closes the specified dialog frame, or all frames if no `id` is
  provided.

LyteNyte Grid manages the dialog state, while you handle rendering using your preferred library.

Example below uses the [dialog component from Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/dialog),
but any dialog component library can be used.

## Why Use the Grid's Dialog Frame?

The key advantage is **context management**. Defining dialogs at the grid level means:

- You can open dialogs directly from grid components (e.g., cell renderers) with the right context.
- You avoid building custom state management or using React Context for dialog coordination.
- You focus on dialog rendering while the grid handles orchestration.

This approach simplifies integration and ensures dialogs work seamlessly with grid-level state and
interactions.
