  CSS modules provide scoped class names for writing isolated CSS.

Review the basic theming approaches in LyteNyte Grid by reading our [Grid Theming guide](/docs/grid-theming).
This guide assumes you already understand the data attributes used to style LyteNyte Grid elements.

## CSS Modules Setup

Depending on your framework, CSS modules may work without additional configuration. For example,
when using [Vite](https://vite.dev/guide/features#css-modules), any CSS file ending
with `.module.css` is treated as a CSS module. [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/css#css-modules)
follows the same convention.

If you are not using Next.js or Vite, consult your framework's documentation. If needed,
refer to the official [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) documentation.

## Styling With Scoped Styles

To style LyteNyte Grid using CSS modules, create a module file and define classes that
target grid elements through their data attributes—such as `data-ln-header-cell` and `data-ln-cell`.
The example below illustrates this:

!demo:Styling With CSS Modules="./demos/styling-with-modules"

In the example, we create a module file (`style.module.css`).
The CSS inside the file is standard vanilla CSS:

```css
.cell {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  background-color: light-dark(cyan, navy);
  color: light-dark(black, white);
}

.headerCell {
  background-color: light-dark(white, black);
  color: gray;
}
```

Now import the module and attach the styles to the appropriate LyteNyte Grid elements:

```tsx
import styles from "./style.module.css";

// In JSX
<Grid.Cell key={c.id} cell={c} className={styles.cell} />;
```

The `styles.cell` class applies only to `<Grid.Cell>`. This scoping behavior is
the primary advantage of CSS modules—styles in one module do not conflict with
class names defined elsewhere.

## Styling Elements Not Directly Exposed

The [Grid Theming guide](/docs/grid-theming) explains that some LyteNyte Grid
elements are not directly exposed through its public component interface. You must
style these elements using data attributes or other explicit selectors.
When using CSS modules, nested selectors are the recommended way to target these elements.

### Styling Row Detail

To style the row-detail element with CSS modules, target the element that has
the `data-ln-row-detail` attribute. The example below demonstrates this by defining a
`rowDetail` class in a CSS module.

!demo:CSS Modules Styling Row Detail="./demos/row-detail-modules"

Here is the associated CSS module. The nested selectors make the rule slightly more
complex, but still easy to follow:

```css
.rowDetail {
  & [data-ln-row-detail="true"] {
    padding: 24px;

    & > div {
      border: 1px solid gray;
      border-radius: 8px;
      background-color: light-dark(cyan, rgb(0, 0, 0));
    }
  }
}
```

Apply the `rowDetail` class to the grid row:

```tsx
<Grid.Row row={row} key={row.id} className={styles.rowDetail} />
```

### Styling Cell Selection Ranges

You can style cell-selection rectangles using the same nested selector pattern.
Create a class that targets the `data-ln-cell-selection-rect` attribute and apply
it at an appropriate wrapper level. The example below demonstrates this approach:

!demo:Cell Selection Styling With CSS Modules="./demos/cell-selection-rect-modules"

Here is the CSS module used to style the selection rectangle:

```css
.cellStyles {
  [data-ln-cell-selection-rect] {
    background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.2);
    border: 1px solid green;
    border-radius: 8px;
  }
}
```

## CSS Modules and Pre-built Themes

You can style LyteNyte Grid entirely with CSS modules, but this is not required.
You may also combine a pre-built LyteNyte Grid theme with custom CSS module classes.
The example below demonstrates how to enhance an existing theme:

!demo:Prebuilt Themes and CSS Modules="./demos/grid-theming-modules"

In the demo, the pre-built theme provides the base styling, and CSS modules
add additional cell-specific styles. This works seamlessly because the pre-built
themes are plain CSS and CSS modules simply scope class names.

- [Columns](/docs/columns): understand how column configuration influences the grid view.
- [Cell Renderers](/docs/cell-custom-renderers): define custom cell renderers for greater control over cell content.
