title: Grid Theming With CSS Modules
description: LyteNyte Grid may be styled using CSS modules. CSS modules are a great way to
  write CSS styles that are scoped to specific classes.

It's recommended that you familiarize yourself with the basic theming approaches in LyteNyte
Grid by reading our [Grid Theming guide](/docs/grid-theming). The content of this guide assumes
the developer is already aware of the data attributes used to style various LyteNyte elements.

## CSS Modules Setup

Depending on your framework CSS modules may work out the box without any configuration necessary.
For example if you using [Vite](https://vite.dev/guide/features#css-modules), then any CSS file
ending with `.module.css` wil lbe considered a CSS module. The same approach is taken by
[NextJS](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/css#css-modules).

If you aren't using NextJS or Vite, consult the documentation of your framework of choice, otherwise
the next best place to get started is with the [CSS modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)
documentation.

## Styling With Scoped Styles

To style LyteNyte Grid using CSS modules, start by creating your module file. In the module file create a
style for header cells and grid cells by targeting the respective data attributes (`data-ln-header-cell` and `data-ln-cell`).
The example below demonstrates this:

!demo:Styling With CSS Modules="./demos/styling-with-modules"

In the example, we start by creating our module file (`style.module.css`). Notice the CSS in the file looks
like normal vanilla CSS, and it is.

```css
.cell {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  background-color: light-dark(cyan, navy);
  color: light-dark(black, white);
}

.headerCell {
  background-color: light-dark(white, black);
  color: gray;
}
```

Then we can import our CSS module and apply the styles to the various LyteNyte Grid elements.

```tsx
import styles from "./style.module.css";

// In the JSX content
<Grid.Cell key={c.id} cell={c} className={styles.cell} />;
```

The `styles.cell` will be scoped to the `<Grid.Cell>`. This is the main benefit of CSS modules, styles are
scoped to their module and will not conflict with other similar styles defined elsewhere.

## Styling Elements Not Directly Exposed

The [Grid Theming guide](/docs/grid-theming) explains that some elements are not directly exposed by LyteNyte Grid's
public component interface. These elements must be styled using data attributes (or with some other CSS selector of
your choice). When using CSS modules, nested CSS selectors are the recommended approach to style these sort of elements.

### Styling Row Detail

To style the row detail element using CSS modules we need to target the element with `data-ln-row-detail` attribute set.
The example below does this by creating a `rowDetail` class in a CSS module.

!demo:CSS Modules Styling Row Detail="./demos/row-detail-modules"

The CSS module style itself is a slightly more complex than normal but is still relative simple:

```css
.rowDetail {
  & [data-ln-row-detail="true"] {
    padding: 24px;

    & > div {
      border: 1px solid gray;
      border-radius: 8px;
      background-color: light-dark(cyan, rgb(0, 0, 0));
    }
  }
}
```

The `rowDetail` class is then applied to the grid's row element:

```tsx
<Grid.Row row={row} key={row.id} className={styles.rowDetail} />
```

### Styling Cell Selection Ranges

Like the row detail container, the cell selection rects can be styled using a nested data attribute selected in a
class created by a CSS module. The example below demonstrates this using the nested CSS data attribute selector.

!demo:Cell Selection Styling With CSS Modules="./demos/cell-selection-rect-modules"

The module is applied higher than the grid and targets any cell selection rect.

```css
.cellStyles {
  [data-ln-cell-selection-rect] {
    background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.2);
    border: 1px solid green;
    border-radius: 8px;
  }
}
```

## CSS Modules and Pre-built Themes

In the example above, LyteNyte Grid is styled from scratch. However, this is not a requirement. We can instead
use one of the prebuilt LyteNyte Grid themes and then use CSS modules to further enhance the styles applied.
The example below demonstrates this:

!demo:Prebuilt Themes and CSS Modules="./demos/grid-theming-modules"

In the demo we apply the prebuilt theme, and then additionally apply our CSS module classes to the grid cell.
This is perfect valid, since the themes provided are normal CSS and CSS modules is just a scoping mechanism for
vanilla CSS.

## Next Steps

- [Grid Theming](/docs/grid-theming): if you haven't already, reading our general grid theming guide will be very beneficial in learning to style LyteNyte Grid.
- [Columns](/docs/columns): the grid view is largely influenced by what columns are displayed in it. See our columns guide to learn more about controlling what is displayed.
- [Cell Renderers](/docs/cell-custom-renderers): see how to define custom cell renderers for more customization of what the grid displays in individual cells.
