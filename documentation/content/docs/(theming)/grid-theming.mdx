title: Grid Theming
description: LyteNyte Grid is a headless data grid. This guide will cover the basic
  approach to theming LyteNyte Grid and how to use vanilla CSS or one of our pre-built
  themes to create a visually stunning data grid.

<Callout>

As a headless data grid, no colors, font styles, borders, or backgrounds are applied to LyteNyte Grid.
There are however, inline styles that are necessary for the grid layout calculations and row and column
virtualization. These styles should not be overridden. Fortunately, inline styles are quite specific, so
you would have to go out your way to create a very specific CSS selector that would override LyteNyte Grid's
functional styles.

## Applying Styles

LyteNyte Grid is headless. Most components expose props for styling,
but some such as cell selection overlay rectangles -are not directly
accessible. These must be styled with CSS selectors.

For exposed components, simply add your CSS classes or inline styles.
For example, with
[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), styling a cell is as easy as:

```tsx
<Grid.Cell className="flex items-center text-sm" />
```

This familiar approach means you can style the grid with your existing
design system, without reinventing a new approach to styling a grid.

### Styling Considerations

While unstyled, LyteNyte Grid applies essential inline styles for
`position`, `width`, `height`, and `box-sizing`. Avoid overriding these
as they are necessary for correct grid behavior.

Pinned (frozen) elements are transparent. Always give each cell and
header cell its own background color. Styling only the row is not
enough because pinned elements share the same row.

An easy method is to target the grid's data attributes:

```css
[data-ln-header-cell="true"],
[data-ln-header-group="true"],
[data-ln-cell="true"],
[data-ln-row="true"][data-ln-rowtype="full-width"] {
  background-color: black;
  color: white;
}
```

You can style each selector individually. For reference, check the
LyteNyte themes in our
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/1771-Technologies/lytenyte/blob/main/packages/lytenyte-core/main.css).

## Provided Themes

LyteNyte Grid provides seven ready-to-use themes. To apply one, add its theme class—along with the
`lng-grid` class—to a parent element (typically `html` or `body`).

- `lng1771-teal`: Teal-accent theme.
- `lng1771-term256`: Terminal-style color theme.
- `dark`: Standard dark theme.
- `light`: Standard light theme.
- `lng1771-shadcn-light`: Light theme based on shadcn color tokens. Use in projects that adopt shadcn.
- `lng1771-shadcn-dark`: Dark theme based on shadcn color tokens. Use in projects that adopt shadcn.
- `lng1771-cotton-candy`: Playful theme for friendly, colorful data grid views.
