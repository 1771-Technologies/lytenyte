<Callout>

As a headless data grid, LyteNyte Grid applies no colors, fonts, borders, or backgrounds by default.
However, it does include inline styles required for layout calculations and row or column virtualization.
These functional styles should not be overridden. Because inline styles have high specificity,
they are unlikely to be affected unless you deliberately create an extremely specific CSS selector.

</Callout>

## Pre-built Themes

The fastest way to create a visually polished grid is by using one of the built-in LyteNyte Grid themes.
To apply a theme, add the `lng-grid` class to any HTML element above the grid, then
include the class name of the theme you want to use.

LyteNyte Grid provides seven ready-to-use themes. Add the theme class, along with the
`lng-grid` class, to a parent element (typically `html` or `body`):

- `lng1771-teal`: Teal-accent theme.
- `lng1771-term256`: Terminal-style color theme.
- `dark`: Standard dark theme.
- `light`: Standard light theme.
- `lng1771-shadcn-light`: Light theme based on shadcn color tokens. Use in projects that adopt shadcn.
- `lng1771-shadcn-dark`: Dark theme based on shadcn color tokens. Use in projects that adopt shadcn.
- `lng1771-cotton-candy`: Playful, colorful theme for friendly data grid views.

The demo below shows how each theme looks in practice. For a complete example with
auxiliary components, visit our [live demo](https://www.1771technologies.com/demo) page,
which includes a theme toggle.

You can also create a custom theme from scratch. LyteNyte Grid is unopinionated about
your styling method and works with any approach. The rest of this guide explains
how to style the grid using vanilla CSS and inline styles. Even if you use a framework
like Tailwind, reviewing these examples will help you understand the styling attributes available in LyteNyte Grid.

## Styling Through Data Attributes

LyteNyte Grid makes extensive use of data attributes on grid elements.
Data attributes are custom pieces of information attached to an HTML element.
They always begin with the `data-` prefix. For example, each cell element includes the
attribute `data-ln-cell="true"`. All LyteNyte Grid data attributes begin with the `data-ln`
prefix, where `ln` stands for LyteNyte. Using these attributes is an effective
way to target specific parts of the grid for CSS styling.

In the demo below, every cell is styled with a black background and gray
text (white background in light mode). Header elements use a navy background with
white text (cyan background and black text in light mode).

!demo:Data Attribute Styling="./demos/data-attributes"

The CSS uses the [attribute selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Selectors/Attribute_selectors), as shown below:

```css
.data-styles {
  [data-ln-cell="true"] {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    padding-inline: 8px;
    background-color: light-dark(white, black);
    color: gray;
  }

  [data-ln-header-cell="true"] {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    padding-inline: 8px;
    background-color: light-dark(cyan, navy);
    color: light-dark(black, white);
  }
}
```

Wrap the styles in a `data-styles` class to apply them on a per-grid basis.
If you prefer to apply them globally, remove the wrapper class.

### Commonly Used Data Attributes

It is useful to understand which data attributes apply to each element.
You can inspect the rendered grid in your browser's developer tools, but
the most common attributes are listed below for convenience.

### Header Elements

Each header element includes an attribute indicating its type:

- `Grid.Viewport`: `data-ln-viewport`
- `Grid.Header`: `data-ln-header`
- `Grid.HeaderRow`: `data-ln-header-row`
- `Grid.HeaderGroupCell`: `data-ln-header-group`
- `Grid.HeaderCell`: `data-ln-header-cell`

Additionally, `Grid.HeaderCell` may include `data-ln-header-floating`
to indicate that the cell belongs to the floating header.

Some elements also include attributes for contextual styling. For example,
`Grid.HeaderCell` includes `data-ln-colpin` to indicate the pin
section (`start`, `center`, or `end`). It may also include `data-ln-last-start-pin`
or `data-ln-first-end-pin` to indicate whether the cell is the last in the start section or the first in the end section.

`Grid.HeaderGroupCell` includes attributes describing its state. The
`data-ln-collapsible` attribute indicates that the group cell can collapse,
while `data-ln-collapsed` reflects the current collapse state.

Use these attributes to precisely target header elements for custom styling.

### Row and Cell Elements

Each row and cell element includes an identifying data attribute:

- `Grid.RowsContainer`: `data-ln-rows-container`
- `Grid.RowsTop`: `data-ln-rows-top`
- `Grid.RowsCenter`: `data-ln-rows-center`
- `Grid.RowsBottom`: `data-ln-rows-bottom`
- `Grid.Row`: `data-ln-row`
- `Grid.RowFullWidth`: `data-ln-row` and `data-ln-rowtype="full-width"`
- `Grid.Cell`: `data-ln-cell`

Additional contextual attributes support conditional styling. For example,
`Grid.Row` may include `data-ln-last-top-pin` or `data-ln-first-bottom-pin`
to indicate whether the row is the last top-pinned or first bottom-pinned row.

Using these attributes provides a consistent and reliable way to
target specific parts of LyteNyte Grid for styling.

## Styling Through Classes

LyteNyte Grid offers flexible styling options. Because each component is exposed,
you can apply any number of classes to its elements. Use this approach when you
have an existing design system and want LyteNyte Grid to match it.

The example below styles grid elements using predefined classes and
the [clsx](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx) library to conditionally apply styles
based on column type.

!demo:Styling With Classes="./demos/styling-with-classnames"

The CSS is straightforward. The example below shows how the classes
are applied through the `className` property on the components.

```css
.cell {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  background-color: light-dark(cyan, navy);
  color: light-dark(black, white);
}

.cell-number {
  justify-content: flex-end;
}

.header-cell {
  background-color: light-dark(white, black);
  color: gray;
}
```

## Styling Through Inline Styles

You can also style LyteNyte Grid elements using inline styles. This approach works
well when style values are dynamic and available in JavaScript. For example, a simple
theme editor can be built this way, although it is not generally recommended.

!demo:Inline Styles="./demos/grid-inline-styles"

Inline styles are applied directly to each component. For example, the `Grid.Cell`
component can use the `style` property as shown below:

```tsx
<Grid.Cell
  key={c.id}
  cell={c}
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    alignItems: "center",
    paddingInline: "8px",
    background: cellBg,
    color: cellFg,
  }}
/>
```

<Callout>

Use caution when applying inline styles. The same maintainability issues
common to inline styles also apply in LyteNyte Grid. When used selectively,
inline styles can simplify code, but avoid using them for every grid element.

</Callout>

## Styling Elements Not Directly Exposed

Most LyteNyte Grid components are accessible through the headless interface.
However, for convenience, some advanced features are rendered
and controlled internally by LyteNyte Grid. These elements include:

- The row detail container (master detail container)
- The cell selection rectangles

To style these elements, you must target them directly using CSS.
In most cases, a single selector is enough to apply your styles. If you
are using one of our pre-built themes, these elements are already styled.

### Styling the Row Detail (Master Detail) Container

The example below shows a grid with a single row detail expanded. Styles
for the detail container are applied by targeting the row element
that includes the `data-ln-row-detail` attribute.

<Callout>

In the demo, the grid's overflow is set to `hidden` for illustration only.
In practice, allowing the grid to scroll is recommended.

</Callout>

!demo:Styling Row Detail="./demos/row-detail-styling"

The applied styles are simple. Padding is added to the detail container, and a border is
applied to its direct `div` descendant. You can adapt this approach as needed
to fit your use case.

```css
[data-ln-row-detail="true"] {
  padding: 24px;

  & > div {
    border: 1px solid gray;
    border-radius: 8px;
    background-color: light-dark(cyan, rgb(0, 0, 0));
  }
}
```

### Styling the Cell Selection Rectangle

The cell selection rectangle consists of `div` elements created by LyteNyte Grid
to show the range of selected cells. This is a PRO feature available
in LyteNyte Grid PRO. You can style the selection rectangles using data
attributes, primarily `data-ln-cell-selection-rect`.

!demo:Cell Selection Styling="./demos/cell-selection-rect"

In this example, the cell selection rectangle is styled using the CSS below,
which targets the selection rectangles generated by LyteNyte Grid
when selection ranges are active.

```css
[data-ln-cell-selection-rect] {
  background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.2);
  border: 1px solid green;
  border-radius: 8px;
}
```

## Layout Constraints

LyteNyte Grid is mostly headless and unstyled, but some functional inline
styles are necessary for layout and rendering. These styles control cell
sizing and positioning. Avoid overriding them to ensure the grid renders correctly.

Functional styles typically affect properties such as
`width`, `height`, `top`, `left`, and `transform`. Avoid applying
`margin` directly to grid elements, as it may interfere with layout calculations.

LyteNyte Grid applies its functional styles inline, which gives them high specificity.
As a result, it is difficult to unintentionally override these styles.
In most cases, conflicts will only occur if you create an extremely specific CSS selector.
