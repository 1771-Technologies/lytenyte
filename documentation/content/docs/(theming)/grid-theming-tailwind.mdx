title: Grid Theming With Tailwind
description: Tailwind may be used to directly style LyteNyte Grid. This guide covers the
  setup and approach to styling the various grid elements using Tailwind.
---

This guide covers uses Tailwind has a an atomic CSS framework for styling LyteNyte Grid as its
the most popular atomic CSS framework. However, the approach described here is equally applicable to
other atomic CSS frameworks, such as [UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev/).

<Callout>

It's highly recommend to read the general [Grid Theming Guide](/docs/grid-theming) before going through
this guide to gain a better understanding of the styling approaches possible with LyteNyte Grid.

Furthermore, this guide assumes you are using Tailwind V4, although translation back to Tailwind V3
is relatively straightforward.

## Tailwind Theming Setup

The first thing to do when using Tailwind is to get the framework setup. The correct approach depends on your
React framework of choice. See Tailwind's [installation guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite)
for specific details.

This guide will assume that you have Tailwind setup with the default configuration. Hence, you will have a CSS
file with the following content:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
```

If you are not sure which framework to use, we recommend starting with [Vite](https://vite.dev/). The project
setup is simple and the Tailwind configuration is directly supported by an official Tailwind plugin.

## Applying Tailwind Classes

LyteNyte Grid is exposed a set of headless components that are used to form the grid view. These components all
accept the normal HTML properties you would expect, including the `className` field. This means that styling the
grid using Tailwind css is as straightforward as applying the atomic CSS classes.

The example below demonstrates this using the standard Tailwind color palette.

!demo:LyteNyte Grid Styled With Tailwind="./demos/tailwind-styles"

Notice from the code the CSS classes are applied in the normal Tailwind fashion. There is no special configuration
required. For example, the `Grid.Cell` is styled as follows:

```tsx
<Grid.Cell
  key={c.id}
  cell={c}
  className="flex items-center bg-gray-50 px-2 text-sm text-gray-800"
/>
```

### Class Variance Authority

Directly applying classes to the element is fine for simple styling uses cases, but it is not enough to
cover the various styling demands that are sometimes required for feature rich data grids. Luckily there
are a set of Tailwind utilities that can make applying conditional styles pleasant. The approach described
here will required three libraries to be installed:

- [`tailwind-merge`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwind-merge)
- [`clsx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clsx)
- [`class-variant-authority`](https://cva.style/docs)

Start by creating a `tw` utility function from `tailwind-merge` and `clsx`:

```ts
import type { ClassValue } from "clsx";
import clsx from "clsx";
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge";

export function tw(...c: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(...c));
}
```

<Callout>

If you are already using a Tailwind based framework, such as shadcn/ui, the `tw`
function may already be defined, potentially under a different name, for example
`cn` in the case of shadcn/ui.

</Callout>

Next define the variants of grid cells using the `class-variance-authority` library. The
basic code for this shown below:

```ts
const cellStyles = cva("flex items-center bg-gray-50 px-2 text-sm text-gray-800", {
  variants: {
    number: {
      true: "justify-end tabular-nums",
    },
    row: {
      odd: "bg-slate-50 dark:bg-slate-950",
      even: "bg-slate-100 dark:bg-slate-900",
    },
    header: {
      true: "capitalize bg-gray-100 text-gray-700",
    },
  },
});
```

Using the `cva` function we now have a function that we can call that provides the base styles and
variants on the base style that should be applied to the cells in the grid.

The example below puts this all together and shows how simple it is to provide varying grid styles
using Tailwind and some of the utility libraries available:

!demo:Tailwind Styling With CVA="./demos/tailwind-cva"

Notice how the CSV style is applied to the grid cell now:

```tsx
<Grid.Cell
  key={c.id}
  cell={c}
  className={tw(
    cellStyles({
      number: c.column.type === "number",
      row: c.rowIndex % 2 ? "even" : "odd",
    }),
  )}
/>
```

This approach ensures that styles are consistently applied, and variants on the base styles are easy
to maintain.

## Styling Elements Not Directly Exposed

The [Grid Theming guide](/docs/grid-theming) explains that some elements are not directly
exposed by LyteNyte Grid's public component interface. These elements must be styled using
data attributes (or some other CSS selector of your choice).

Using Tailwind it is possible to style these elements, however, it requires using more advanced
Tailwind syntax for selecting child elements that others may not be familiar with. This section
will cover how to style the row detail and cell selection ranges using Tailwind.

### Styling Row Detail

To style the row detail element using tailwind we need to target the element with `data-ln-row-detail`
attribute set. Ideally we should do this without creating a separate CSS file. Tailwind allows child
selectors to be applied.

!demo:Tailwind Styling Row Detail="./demos/row-detail-tailwind"

The selector for the detail row looks complex but it's actually quite straightforward. The code is shown below.
The first part is the `&` symbol, which tells Tailwind to select the current element, the `[data-ln-row-detail="true"]`
selects the descendant with the matching data attribute, finally the `>div` selected the `div` that is a direct d
descendant of the current element. If you are unfamiliar with this Tailwind syntax see the official
[Tailwind guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#using-arbitrary-variants) on arbitrary selectors.

```tsx
<Grid.Row
  row={row}
  key={row.id}
  className={tw(
    '[&_[data-ln-row-detail="true"]>div]:rounded-lg',
    '[&_[data-ln-row-detail="true"]>div]:border',
    '[&_[data-ln-row-detail="true"]>div]:border-gray-500',
    '[&_[data-ln-row-detail="true"]]:p-7`',
  )}
></Grid.Row>
```

This is one approach that directly styles detail element inline. Another approach is to create a separate CSS file
and target the row detail element directly in that file. This is possible since Tailwind is nothing more than
inlined vanilla CSS.

### Styling Cell Selection Ranges

Like the row detail container, the cell selection rects can be styled using arbitrary Tailwind selectors. The selector
will be different and will be placed on the rows container as opposed to individual rows, but the overall approach is the
same. The example below demonstrates this:

!demo:Cell Selection Styling With Tailwind="./demos/cell-selection-rect-tailwind"

In the example we use the all descendants selector to target any and all cell section rects. This is a direct
inline approach to styling the rects. There is nothing that stops that rects from being styled in a separate
CSS file.

```tsx
<Grid.RowsContainer
  className={tw(
    "**:data-[ln-cell-selection-rect]:bg-green-500/10",
    "**:data-[ln-cell-selection-rect]:border-green-500",
    "**:data-[ln-cell-selection-rect]:border",
    "**:data-[ln-cell-selection-rect]:rounded-lg",
  )}
/>
```

## Mixing Tailwind and Pre-built Themes

Fully theming LyteNyte Grid from scratch may be require quite a few styles to be applied. Whilst users who
want their grid to match their design system exactly may prefer to style LyteNyte Grid from scratch, it may
be better to start from an initial pre-made theme and then adjust styles as necessary.

Since Tailwind doesn't prevent the inclusion of other CSS libraries or styles, its possible to combine a prebuilt
theme with Tailwind classes for adjustments. This is actually what we do for most of the demos in the 1771
Technologies website. The example below demonstrates an example that uses Tailwind with any of the provided
grid themes.

!demo:Pre-built Themes With Tailwind="./demos/grid-theming"

### Theme Variables

When using one of the provided prebuilt themes its useful to define Tailwind theme variables to allow
the same colors to be used across your application. The CSS code below shows the defined theme variables
you can use for Tailwind.

```css
@theme {
  --color-ln-gray-00: var(--lng1771-gray-00);
  --color-ln-gray-02: var(--lng1771-gray-02);
  --color-ln-gray-05: var(--lng1771-gray-05);
  --color-ln-gray-10: var(--lng1771-gray-10);
  --color-ln-gray-20: var(--lng1771-gray-20);
  --color-ln-gray-30: var(--lng1771-gray-30);
  --color-ln-gray-40: var(--lng1771-gray-40);
  --color-ln-gray-50: var(--lng1771-gray-50);
  --color-ln-gray-60: var(--lng1771-gray-60);
  --color-ln-gray-70: var(--lng1771-gray-70);
  --color-ln-gray-80: var(--lng1771-gray-80);
  --color-ln-gray-90: var(--lng1771-gray-90);
  --color-ln-gray-100: var(--lng1771-gray-100);

  --color-ln-primary-05: var(--lng1771-primary-05);
  --color-ln-primary-10: var(--lng1771-primary-10);
  --color-ln-primary-30: var(--lng1771-primary-30);
  --color-ln-primary-50: var(--lng1771-primary-50);
  --color-ln-primary-70: var(--lng1771-primary-70);
  --color-ln-primary-90: var(--lng1771-primary-90);
  --color-ln-focus-outline: var(--lng1771-focus-outline);

  --color-ln-pill-plain-fill: var(--lng1771-pill-plain-fill);
  --color-ln-pill-column-fill: var(--lng1771-pill-column-fill);
  --color-ln-pill-column-stroke: var(--lng1771-pill-column-stroke);
  --color-ln-pill-pivot-fill: var(--lng1771-pill-pivot-fill);
  --color-ln-pill-pivot-stroke: var(--lng1771-pill-pivot-stroke);
  --color-ln-pill-group-fill: var(--lng1771-pill-group-fill);
  --color-ln-pill-group-stroke: var(--lng1771-pill-group-stroke);
  --color-ln-pill-icon-color: var(--lng1771-pill-icon-color);
}
```

## Shadcn and LyteNyte Grid

[Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) has become a popular library for quickly
bootstrapping applications. Whilst shadcn/ui uses Tailwind, it uses a different set of theme
variables than the standard Tailwind colors. LyteNyte comes with a pre-made shadcn/ui theme
out the box. Simply add the `lng-grid lng1771-shadcn` classes to an element above the grid.

!demo:LyteNyte With Shadcn Theme="./demos/grid-theming-shadcn"

The shadcn/ui theme was designed to work with the shadcn/ui tokens. The default set are shown below,
but these will generally be defined in any shadcn project. See the [shadcn/ui theming](https://ui.shadcn.com/themes)
page for more on styling your application using shadcn.

```css
:root {
  --color-background: oklch(0.145 0 0);
  --color-foreground: oklch(0.985 0 0);
  --color-card: oklch(0.205 0 0);
  --color-card-foreground: oklch(0.985 0 0);
