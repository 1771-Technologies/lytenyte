title: Row Aggregations
description:
  Use row aggregations in LyteNyte Grid to calculate and display summary data for grouped rows with
  customizable aggregation functions.
---

LyteNyte Grid uses the `aggModel` in grid state to define how grouped rows are aggregated.  
Aggregations calculate summary values for group rows. Leaf rows are not aggregated-they provide the
source data for the calculations.

## Aggregation Model

`aggModel` is an object where each key corresponds to a key in the final aggregation output. The
output is an object of key value pairs. Often the key matches a column `id`, but it doesn't have to.

Each entry in `aggModel` contains:

- **`fn`** - The aggregation function to apply.

LyteNyte Grid's client data sources include built-in aggregation functions, and you can define
custom ones.

## How Aggregations Are Calculated

The row data source performs the aggregation:

- [Client row data source](/docs/row-client-data-source) - Calculates aggregations in the browser.
- [Server row data source](/docs/row-server-data-source) - Calculates aggregations on the server.

You don't need to define aggregations for every column-apply them only where they make sense.
