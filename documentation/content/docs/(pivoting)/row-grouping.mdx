  Group rows by one or more columns in LyteNyte Grid and customize display and behavior for

Group rows by one or more columns using the `rowGroupModel` property. This property accepts an array
of column `id` strings, where each `id` represents a groupable column.

## Grouping Model

`rowGroupModel` defines how the grid groups data. Each entry creates a group level, producing group
rows that can contain child rows. This creates a tree-like view of your data.

**Note:** Group rows are not aggregated by default, so their cell values appear empty. To aggregate
group rows, see the [Row Aggregation guide](/docs/row-aggregations).

Any column can be added to `rowGroupModel`. It's your responsibility to group only on columns that
make sense for your data.

## Row Group Field Function

Instead of grouping by a column, you can use a custom field object. Pass an object with a `field`
property to perform arbitrary grouping unrelated to any single column.

```ts
export interface RowGroupField<T> {
  readonly kind: "field";
  readonly id: string;
  readonly field: FieldRowGroup<T>;
  readonly name?: string;
}
```

For example, you can group by an age bucket rather than the exact age:

## The Row Group Column

When row groups are applied, LyteNyte Grid creates extra columns for these groups. Control their
display with the `rowGroupDisplayMode` property:

- `"single-column"` - Default. One group column expands/collapses all groups; most space-efficient.
- `"multi-column"` - Creates a separate group column for each item in the row group model.
- `"custom"` - Lets you provide your own expand/collapse column. LyteNyte Grid won't create one.

### Customizing Group Columns

Use the `rowGroupColumn` property to customize group columns. This property accepts a simplified
column configuration that LyteNyte Grid applies when creating group columns.

## Row Group Expansions

The `rowGroupExpansions` property tracks which groups are expanded and controls when child rows are
visible.

If a group isn't listed in `rowGroupExpansions`, the grid uses the `rowGroupDefaultExpansion`
property, which can be:

- **Number** - Expands groups up to that depth.
- **Boolean** - Expands all (`true`) or none (`false`) of the groups by default.

_Depth_ refers to the group's position in the `rowGroupModel`.
