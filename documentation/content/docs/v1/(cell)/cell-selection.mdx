title: Cell Selection
description: Let users select individual cells or cell ranges in LyteNyte Grid with flexible modes and
  programmatic control.
---

LyteNyte Grid lets you select a single range of cells or multiple ranges. Use the `cellSelectionMode`
property in grid state to control selection behavior. The `cellSelections` property tracks the
currently selected cells.

## Range Selection

Set `cellSelectionMode` to `"range"` to allow users to select a continuous block of cells. Users can
click and drag to define the range.

!demo:Range Cell Selection="./demos/cell-selection"

## Multi-Range Selection

Set `cellSelectionMode` to `"multi-range"` to enable selecting multiple, separate cell ranges. Users
can hold **Control** (or **Command** on macOS) to add new ranges. You can also add or remove ranges
programmatically.

import CellSelectionMultiRange from "./demos/cell-selection-multi-range/demo";

!demo:Multi Range Cell Selection="./demos/cell-selection-multi-range"

## Manage Selections

The `cellSelections` property in grid state stores all active selections as rectangles, defined by
their starting and ending row and column indices.

Pinned rows are included in the same coordinate space as unpinned rows. For example, if two rows are
pinned to the top, the first scrollable row has an index of `2`.

## Retrieve Selected Data

Use the `exportDataRect` API method to extract data from selected cells. Pass a rectangle object
that defines the selection area. See the [Any Data Export](/docs/v1/export-any-data) guide for details.
