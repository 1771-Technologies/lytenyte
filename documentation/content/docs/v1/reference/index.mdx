  API is declarative.

  provides to make managing the declarative API easier, and and overview of the convenience methods that extend the
  power and functionality of LyteNyte Grid.

  payload structures, and recommended usage scenarios.

## Using LyteNyte Grid's API

Each instance of LyteNyte Grid get's its own reference to the grid state and API. Creating an
instance is done through the `useLyteNyte` hook:

```ts
const grid = useLyteNyte({ ... })
```

The _ts`grid`_ reference is the main access point to the LyteNyte Grid API:

<AutoTypeTable path="./types.ts" name="Grid" />
