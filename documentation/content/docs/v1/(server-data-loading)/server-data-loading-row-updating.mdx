description: Handle live data updates to display real-time views driven by server events.
  LyteNyte Grid's server data source requests update ticks from the server at a configurable frequency.

## Processing Updates

By default, the LyteNyte Grid server data source does not expect row data to update regularly.
As a result, it does not request updates from the server unless the view changes.
However, the data source provides a `refresh` method that sends data requests
for the current view to the server. Therefore, a real-time data grid
can be established in two steps:

1. Set up the data grid view using the standard non-updating configuration with the `useServerDataSource` hook.
2. Call the `refresh` method whenever the grid should update its rows.

The example below demonstrates this behavior. A `setInterval` polls the server every second
for updates, and the grid refreshes accordingly. The example uses a grouped data view to
show that update ticking works for both flat and grouped views.

### Manually Refreshing the Grid

The `refresh` method described above is a convenience wrapper around two other
methods provided by the LyteNyte Grid server data source:

- `requestsForView`: an atom that returns [Data Request Objects](/docs/v1/reference/row-data-source#datarequest) for the current view.
- `pushRequests`: sends [Data Request Objects](/docs/v1/reference/row-data-source#datarequest) to the
  server to force an update for the slices described by the requests.

Therefore, the following code blocks are equivalent:

```ts
const ds = useServerDataSource({ ... })

ds.refresh()
// Is equivalent to
ds.pushRequests(ds.requestsForView.get())
```

## Data Updating Considerations

Live ticking data grids involve several subtle challenges that many developers,
and even other grid libraries, often fail to handle correctly. Fortunately, most
of these complexities are handled automatically when using LyteNyte Grid's server data source.

### Large Number of Updates

Some data views can display hundreds or even thousands of visible cells that may update
simultaneously and at high frequency. LyteNyte Grid handles these updates efficiently; however,
because updates originate from the server, browser serialization and deserialization
introduce performance costs. In such cases, batching updates is recommended. For example,
request a data refresh every 5 seconds to process updates in 5-second intervals.
The exact implementation depends on the user case. In practice, you are more likely to
encounter network update limits before hitting cell-rendering constraints in LyteNyte Grid.
If you notice performance dips, they are likely occurring in the data-processing layer of your application.

### Consistent Group Updates

When row groups are present, data requests occur per group row and its
children. For example, if a single expanded row group is in view, the view consists of:

- The root data slice containing the group rows
- The child rows of the expanded group

These represent two separate data requests. LyteNyte Grid's `dataFetcher`
provides both slices simultaneously, but if your implementation splits them into
multiple server requests, the returned data may become out of sync. This can occur if the server
data ticks between requests. To prevent this, handle refresh requests together to ensure data consistency.
