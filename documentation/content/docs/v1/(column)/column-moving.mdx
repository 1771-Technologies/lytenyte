title: Column Moving
description: Columns in LyteNyte Grid may be reordered programmatically or through the
  grid's drag-and-drop header interactions. Column groups can also be reordered as a unit.

## Move By Dragging

LyteNyte Grid supports column reordering through the `uiHints` property on each
column definition. Set `movable` to `true` to allow users to drag a column
header to a new position. Click and hold to drag a header in the demo below:

!demo:Move By Dragging="./demos/column-moving_x"

The demo enables moving for all columns by setting `movable` on the base column:

```ts
const grid = Grid.useLyteNyte({
  // Other grid props
  columnBase: {
    uiHints: {
      movable: true,
    },
  },
});
```

### Pinned Columns & Drag Reordering

When the grid has both pinned and scrollable columns, drag-and-drop
reordering updates the column's pin state depending on where you drop it.

- Moving an unpinned column over a pinned column causes the moved column to become pinned.
- Moving a pinned column over an unpinned one unpins the moved column.

Crossing the pinned or scrollable boundary when moving columns changes the pin state.
However, reordering columns within the same section without crossing the boundary leaves it
unchanged. The demo below shows this boundary-based behavior.

!demo:Moving Pinned Columns="./demos/column-moving-pinned_x"

## Dragging Column Groups

Columns in the same group can be dragged together. All columns in the group must
be movable for group dragging to work. In the demo below,
dragging the **Inventory** group moves both the **Product** and **Price** columns:

!demo:Moving Column Groups="./demos/column-moving-group_x"

Moving grouped columns can change the group hierarchy:

- If you drag a column out of its group, LyteNyte splits the group.
- If two columns belong to the same group but are separated in the header
  hierarchy, dragging them next to each other merges the header hierarchy.
- Reordering columns within the same group behaves the same as reordering ungrouped columns.
- If you move an ungrouped column between columns in a group, LyteNyte splits the group.

See the [Column Groups guide](/docs/v1/column-groups) for details on
when groups split and how LyteNyte Grid handles column groups.

## Programmatic Column Reordering

Use `api.columnMove` to reorder columns programmatically. Column order is determined
by the sequence of columns in the grid state, and `api.columnMove`
updates `grid.state.columns` accordingly. For example, the code
below swaps the **ID** and **Product** columns:

```ts
grid.api.columnMove({ moveColumns: ["product"], moveTarget: "id", before: false });
```

For more details, see the [Grid API reference](/docs/v1/reference/grid-api#gridapi).
