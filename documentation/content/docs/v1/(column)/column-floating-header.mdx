title: Column Floating Header
description: LyteNyte Grid's floating row is a specialized header row that appears below the main column headers.
---

Floating header rows let you render custom components for
each column. While often used for filtering components,
it can render any type of component.

Enable the floating row by setting the
`floatingRowEnabled` property on the grid state.
Once enabled, each column can define a floating cell
renderer through the `floatingCellRenderer` property.

The `floatingCellRenderer` may be:

- A React component that LyteNyte Grid renders as the floating cell.
- A string referencing a registered floating cell renderer defined
  on the grid's `floatingCellRenderers` property.

## Floating Component Renderer

When the floating row is enabled, LyteNyte Grid uses each column's `floatingCellRenderer` to decide
what to render in the floating cell. The demo below shows a simple
renderer that provides a basic text filter input.

!demo:Column Floating Cell="./demos/column-floating_x"

In the demo, the floating row renders as a normal `Grid.HeaderCell` component.
LyteNyte Grid determines whether a header cell belongs to the main header
or the floating row based on the `cell` property supplied by the view layout:

```tsx
<Grid.HeaderCell cell={c} />
```

The `cell` object has a `kind` value:

- `"cell"` for a normal header cell.
- `"floating"` for a floating header cell.

See the [Grid View API reference](/docs/v1/reference/grid-view#headercellfloating) for more details.

## Floating Registered Renderer

If `floatingCellRenderer` is a string, LyteNyte Grid treats it as a lookup key
into the grid's `floatingCellRenderers` registry. The demo below shows the same example as above,
but using a registered renderer instead of an inline component:

!demo:Column Floating Cell Registered="./demos/column-floating-registered_x"

String-based renderers are helpful when column definitions must be
serializable. In other cases, prefer using component-based renderers.

```ts
const grid = Grid.useLyteNyte({
  // Other grid props...
  floatingRowEnabled: true,
  floatingCellRenderers: { "string-filter": FloatingFilter },
  columnBase: {
    floatingCellRenderer: "string-filter",
  },
});
```

## Floating Row Visibility Toggling

You can show or hide the floating row by toggling the
`floatingRowEnabled` state. The demo below includes a
switch that updates this state:

!demo:Floating Cell Visibility="./demos/column-floating-visibility_x"

The toggle simply flips the `floatingRowEnabled` value:

```tsx
<SwitchToggle
  label="Toggle Floating Row"
  checked={grid.state.floatingRowEnabled.useValue()}
  onChange={() => {
    grid.state.floatingRowEnabled.set((prev) => !prev);
  }}
/>
```
