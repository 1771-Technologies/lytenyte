title: Marker Column
description: The marker column is an auxiliary column created and managed by
  LyteNyte Grid. It is always pinned to the start of the viewport.
---

Use the marker column for information that does not come from the
row data or for interactive actions that do not fit
cleanly into other columns. Common use cases include:

- Displaying the current row index.
- Rendering a checkbox for row selection.

## Enabling Marker Column

Enable the marker column using the `columnMarkerEnabled` property on the grid
state. When enabled, provide a column specification using the `columnMarker` property.

The demo below shows the marker column displaying row indices.
The displayed index starts at `1`, while actual row indices in
LyteNyte Grid start at `0`.

!demo:Row Index Marker Column="./demos/column-marker_x"

Below is the code that enables the marker column and defines its renderer:

```tsx
const grid = Grid.useLyteNyte({
  // Other grid properties...
  columnMarkerEnabled: true,
  columnMarker: {
    cellRenderer: (p) => {
      return <div>{p.rowIndex + 1}</div>;
    },
  },
});
```

The marker column differs from standard columns and has important restrictions:

- It is always pinned to the start of the viewport.
- It cannot be moved or reordered.
- It is not part of the `columns` state but does affect column display order. When enabled,
  the marker column always appears first, and display index `0` refers to the marker column.

## Selection Marker Column

A common use case for the marker column is row selection.
The marker column can render a checkbox for each row. Because
this is so common, LyteNyte Grid provides the `api.rowHandleSelect`
method to simplify selection logic, including shift-select behavior.

!demo:Marker Column Selection="./demos/column-marker-selection_x"

The demo uses `api.rowHandleSelect` to manage checkbox interactions:

```tsx
<GridCheckbox
  onClick={(ev) => {
    ev.stopPropagation();
    grid.api.rowHandleSelect({ shiftKey: ev.shiftKey, target: ev.target });
  }}
  onKeyDown={(ev) => {
    if (ev.key === "Enter" || ev.key === " ")
      grid.api.rowHandleSelect({ shiftKey: ev.shiftKey, target: ev.target });
  }}
/>
```
