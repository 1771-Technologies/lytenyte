  in LyteNyte Grid.

LyteNyte Grid provides the `grid.api.positionFromElement` method to help implement context menu
functionality. The context menu component itself must come from your preferred UI library.

The example below demonstrates integration with the
[Radix UI Context Menu](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/v1/components/context-menu).

## Integration

In the example, grid rows are wrapped in Radix UI's `ContextMenu.Root`. This illustrates one of the
advantages of a headless grid: you can integrate third-party UI components easily and decide where
and how to attach them.

## Position Resolution

The `grid.api.positionFromElement` method returns either a `PositionUnion` object or `null`.  
A `PositionUnion` represents the resolved grid position of an element and can identify:

- Cell
- Floating cell
- Header cell
- Full-width row
- Header group cell

The element you pass does not have to be the direct grid element-it can be a child element. LyteNyte
Grid resolves it to the correct grid position automatically.
