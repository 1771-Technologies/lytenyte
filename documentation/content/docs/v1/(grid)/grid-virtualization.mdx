## What Is Virtualization

Virtualization determines which elements are visible in the viewport and renders only those elements.
The grid does not render elements outside the viewport. Whenever the viewport changes, such as during
scrolling or resizing, the grid recalculates the visible range and updates the rendered elements.

In this guide, virtualization refers to UI rendering and not to hardware or OS-level virtualization.
Despite the similarity in naming, these are distinct concepts with no overlap.

LyteNyte Grid virtualizes rows and columns only displaying the cells that are visible within the viewport.
LyteNyte Grid's virtualization additionally renders some rows above and below the viewport,
and some columns to the left and right of the viewport to improve the perceived performance
of scrolling. Virtualization serves as the grid's primary performance optimization, and LyteNyte Grid enables it by default.

To see virtualization in action, inspect the grid below using your browser's developer tools. As you scroll,
you will see rows mount and unmount. That behavior shows virtualization at work.

You can implement virtualization in several ways. LyteNyte Grid supports advanced scenarios such as variable
row heights, row detail areas, cell and row spans, and pinned rows and columns. To learn more about general
virtualization techniques, see this [List Virtualization](https://www.patterns.dev/vanilla/virtual-lists/)
guide on [patterns.dev](https://www.patterns.dev/).

## Virtualization Configuration

You can customize or disable the grid's virtualization behavior.
LyteNyte Grid renders all rows and columns visible in the viewport,
along with a small number of rows and columns outside the viewport.
These out-of-view elements form the grid's “overscan.”
You can adjust overscan using four grid properties:

- `rowOverscanTop`
- `rowOverscanBottom`
- `colOverscanStart`
- `colOverscanEnd`

Since overscan affects only out-of-view content, changes may not appear obvious.
To confirm overscan values, inspect the DOM and count the rendered rows
outside the viewport. This is demonstrated in the example below:

!demo:Row Overscan Configuration="./demos/grid-overscan"

In this example, the grid renders 30 extra rows above and below the viewport.
The configuration looks as follows:

```tsx
const grid = Grid.useLyteNyte({
  // Other properties
  rowOverscanTop: 30,
  rowOverscanBottom: 30,
});
```

### Disabling Virtualization

If your dataset is small (fewer than ~100 rows), you may disable virtualization entirely. Use the
`virtualizeRows` and `virtualizeCols` properties to turn virtualization off.

!demo:Disabling Virtualization="./demos/grid-no-virtualization"

In the demo, the dataset includes only 40 rows and a limited number of columns. Rendering everything at once
reduces performance for larger datasets, which holds true for all data grids, not just LyteNyte Grid.

You may need to disable virtualization when printing the grid. Because virtualization removes out-of-view
rows and columns from the DOM, printed output includes only the rendered content. Turning off virtualization
ensures the full dataset appears in the printed result.

## Virtualization Considerations

Virtualization significantly improves performance, but it introduces several important considerations:

- **Grid State**: Since the grid mounts and unmounts row and cell components as they
  enter and exit the viewport, any React state stored inside a cell component disappears
  when that component unmounts. Therefore, it's important to maintain any required state higher in the component tree.
- **DOM Virtualization**: Virtualized rows and columns do not exist in the DOM. Browser-level
  “find in page” cannot match cells outside the viewport, so any DOM queries only return rendered elements.
- **Scroll Speed**: Rapid scrolling, such as dragging the scrollbar to the bottom,
  may reveal a momentary background flash before new content appears. This effect occurs
  because scrolling runs on a separate thread in modern browsers.
  The scroll position updates before the main thread paints the new content.

Some grids mitigate flashes during rapid scrolling by translating content on the main thread,
but that approach causes frame drops and reduces overall application performance.
