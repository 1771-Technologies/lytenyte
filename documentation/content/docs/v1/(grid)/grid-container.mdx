title: Responsive Container
description: Learn how to create a responsive container for LyteNyte Grid using various
  approaches, from fixed sized containers to grid and flex based containers.
---

LyteNyte Grid lacks inherent dimensions. Since the viewport fills its parent container,
the parent must have a defined size for the grid to render correctly.
Although it doesn't have a defined size, LyteNyte Grid remains fully responsive.
To ensure responsiveness, make sure its parent element is responsive.

Place LyteNyte Grid as the sole child of its container.
Do not include sibling elements.

## Pixel Value

Fixed pixel values for `height` and `width` provide the simplest sizing option but
limit flexibility. In most cases, set a fixed `height` and allow the
width to adjust based on the parent container. Set a fixed width only when necessary.

!demo:Pixel Height and Width="./demos/pixel-height-container"

The height of the grid viewport comes from the `div` that contains it, which uses
the following code:

```tsx
<div className="lng-grid" style={{ height: 500 }}>
  {/* Grid components */}
</div>
```

## Flex Height Containers

Flexbox layouts distribute space dynamically. When you assign `flex: 1` to a Flexbox child,
it expands to fill the available space. Since Flexbox containers grow with their content,
wrap LyteNyte Grid in an inner `div` with `position: absolute`, `width: 100%`,
and `height: 100%` to prevent the grid from increasing the container's height.
The grid then fills the space without overflow.

!demo:Flex Height Container="./demos/flex-height-container"

The flex height container uses a series of nested `div`s, as shown below:

```tsx
<div className="lng-grid" style={{ height: 500, display: "flex", flexDirection: "column" }}>
  <div style={{ flex: "1", position: "relative" }}>
    <div style={{ position: "absolute", width: "100%", height: "100%" }}>{/* Grid components */}</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Grid Height Containers

CSS Grid (not to be confused with LyteNyte Grid) provides a flexible layout system.
Within a grid container, LyteNyte Grid expands to fill its assigned
area while remaining properly contained.

!demo:Grid Height Container="./demos/grid-height-container"

The grid height container uses the `grid-template-rows` property, as shown below:

```tsx
<div className="lng-grid" style={{ display: "grid", gridTemplateRows: "500px" }}>
  {/* Grid components */}
</div>
```

Other CSS sizing techniques also work well with LyteNyte Grid.
Choose the approach that best fits your layout requirements.
