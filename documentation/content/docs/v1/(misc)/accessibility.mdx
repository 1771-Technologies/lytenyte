  inclusive, accessible data grids.

Accessibility ensures all users can navigate and interact with your
application, regardless of ability. LyteNyte Grid provides robust,
standards-compliant accessibility features. This guide outlines the key
capabilities and best practices.

## Accessibility Compliance

LyteNyte Grid meets the W3C's [WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) guidelines.
It supports all three conformance levels-A, AA, and AAA. Meeting AA
requirements also satisfies most [ADA](https://www.ada.gov/) standards.

The grid uses ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes on
rows, cells, and headers. Screen readers interpret these attributes to
help visually impaired users understand structure and content.

## ARIA Roles and Properties

LyteNyte Grid applies ARIA roles and properties to remain spec-compliant
and accessible.

### Grid Roles

The main container uses `role="grid"`. It also applies:

- `aria-rowcount`: total rows in the grid
- `aria-colcount`: total columns in the grid
- `aria-multiselectable="true"`: only when multiple row selection is
  enabled

### Row Roles

The grid uses `role="row"` for individual rows and `role="rowgroup"` for
row containers.

- For `rowgroup`: `aria-expanded` shows whether the group is open or
  collapsed
- For `row`:
  - `aria-rowindex`: row's position in the grid
  - `aria-selected`: whether the row is selected

### Header Cell Roles

Headers use `role="columnheader"` and may include:

- `aria-colindex`: column's position in the grid
- `aria-expanded`: open/collapsed state
- `aria-sort`: current sort direction

### Grid Cell Roles

Cells use `role="gridcell"` and may include:

- `aria-colindex`: column's position in the grid
- `aria-selected`: whether the cell is selected

## Considerations for Visual Accessibility

### Screen Readers

LyteNyte Grid works with major screen readers, including:

- [JAWS](https://support.freedomscientific.com/Downloads/JAWS)
- [VoiceOver](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/voiceover/welcome/10)

It follows W3C standards to ensure a smooth, predictable reading
experience.

### Color Accessibility

Roughly 300 million people worldwide experience some form of color
blindness ([source](https://www.colourblindawareness.org/colour-blindness/)).
Use accessible colors to meet AA standards and maintain readability.

Recommended palettes:

- [Radix UI Colors](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors)
- [Tailwind Colors](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/v1/customizing-colors)

Accessible color choices keep data visually clear for all users.

## Conclusion

LyteNyte Grid embeds accessibility into its core design. Use ARIA roles,
test with screen readers, and choose inclusive color palettes to deliver
a grid that works for everyone. Regularly test with assistive
technologies to maintain a seamless, inclusive experience.
