description: Learn how to use column pivoting in LyteNyte Grid to dynamically generate columns
  from row data values and calculate measures across dimensions.

Column pivoting transforms values of a column into new columns in your grid. Set the
`columnPivotModel` property on grid state to enable this feature.

LyteNyte Grid creates unique state for pivot columns with their own sort and filter settings.

Your underlying data source must support column pivoting. Since pivots derive from row values,
creating columns from these values depends on your data source. Both the
[Client Row Data Source](/docs/v1/row-client-data-source) and
[Server Row Data Source](/docs/v1/row-server-data-source) support column pivoting.

## Pivoting

To start column pivoting:

1. Set the value of the `columnPivotModel` to the pivot configuration to display.
2. Set `columnPivotMode` to `true` on the grid state.

The example below shows the simplest column pivot configuration the grid may use. Here,
we pivot on the `job` column, turning its values into columns and measure the `balance`
column as a sum of our pivoted `job` columns.

## Pivots and Row Groups

Pivots are an aggregate operation. They only make sense when data is aggregated across the pivot
column. LyteNyte Grid supports break these aggregations into groups by supplying the `columnPivotModel`
with rows to group on. The example below does this by grouping on the `education` and `marital` columns.
