description: Implement Excel export in LyteNyte Grid using third-party libraries like ExcelJS.
---

LyteNyte Grid does not include built-in Excel export to keep the bundle size small. Instead, use
established open-source libraries to generate Excel files. This approach avoids adding large
dependencies to the grid.

This guide shows how to use [ExcelJS](https://github.com/exceljs/exceljs) to create downloadable
Excel files from your grid data.

## How It Works

Use the `exportDataRect` API method to retrieve the grid's data for export. Pass this data into your
ExcelJS logic to populate and style the spreadsheet. For details on `exportDataRect`, see the
[Export Any Data](/docs/v1/export-any-data) guide.
