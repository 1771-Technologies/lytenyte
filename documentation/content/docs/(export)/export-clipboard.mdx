  Use LyteNyte Grid's clipboard API methods to implement copy, cut, and paste with customizable
  transform options.

LyteNyte Grid does not provide a direct API for clipboard operations, but it offers methods you can
combine to implement copy, cut, and paste. Pair these methods with
[cell selection](/docs/cell-selection) to support familiar spreadsheet-style interactions.

- Use `api.exportDataRect` to retrieve data for the full grid or a selected section.
- Use `api.editUpdate` to modify cell values.

## Clipboard Operation Flow

The basic approach for clipboard support is:

- **Copy** - Call `api.exportDataRect` to get the selected data, then write it to the clipboard.
- **Cut** - Call `api.exportDataRect` to get the selected data, write it to the clipboard, then call
  `api.editUpdate` to clear those cells.  
  **Note:** `api.editUpdate` requires the cells to be editable. See the [cell editing](/docs/cell-editing)
  guide for details.
- **Paste** - Read and parse the clipboard content, then call `api.editUpdate` to update the target
  cells.

<Note>

As an alternative to `exportDataRect`, call `exportCsv` to get a string that can be written directly
to the clipboard.

## Example

The following example demonstrates copy, cut, and paste in a simple grid setup.
