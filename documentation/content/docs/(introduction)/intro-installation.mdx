# Installation

Install LyteNyte Grid with a package manager or import its assets from a CDN.

LyteNyte Grid is available in two editions:

- **Core Edition** ([Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)): Free, open-source edition that contains all the essential grid features.

- **PRO Edition** ([commercial license](https://www.1771technologies.com/eula)): Paid, enhanced edition that includes everything in Core, plus advanced
  capabilities for large-scale and complex use cases, such as server-side data loading, pivoting, tree data, and more.

Both editions can be installed from the NPM registry using your preferred package manager.

```package-install
@1771technologies/lytenyte-pro
```

```package-install
@1771technologies/lytenyte-core
```

## Upgrading to PRO

LyteNyte Grid PRO extends LyteNyte Grid Core. If you start with LyteNyte Grid Core and later
upgrade to PRO, you only need to update the package imports. Simply replace:

```ts
import { Grid } from "@1771technologies/lytenyte-core";
```

With:

```ts
import { Grid } from "@1771technologies/lytenyte-pro";
```

## Trial Licensing

The **PRO edition** requires a valid **Developer PRO** or **Organization PRO** license for production.

You can install and evaluate it without a license. The grid will remain fully functional,
but a persistent watermark will appear in both development and production.
To remove the watermark, activate your license key as explained in
the [License Activation guide](/docs/intro-license-activation).

## CDN Installation

LyteNyte Grid is available via CDN through NPM's distribution network. While the package offers various
entry points depending on your component requirements, the following CDN
links provide access to all available code files:

- [**unpkg**](https://app.unpkg.com/@1771technologies/lytenyte-pro/files/dist)
- [**JsDelivr**](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@1771technologies/lytenyte-pro/dist/)

## Source Installation

The complete source code for LyteNyte Grid is publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/1771-Technologies/lytenyte).
You can clone and build the project directly from source if your project requires customization.

**Important:** When building from source, you must adhere to the respective licenses
for both editions. Using or developing code from the PRO source requires a valid license to be purchased.
Please review the LyteNyte Grid [End User License Agreement](/eula) for complete legal terms.
