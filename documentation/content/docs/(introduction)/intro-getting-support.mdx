# Getting Support

How to get support for LyteNyte Grid.

Support is not an afterthought at 1771 Technologies. It is vital to our mission of
building products that just work. This guide describes your support
options so you can get fast, reliable help.

## GitHub

The primary support channel for LyteNyte Grid is our public
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/1771-Technologies/lytenyte).

Here we track:

- Bug reports
- Feature requests
- Documentation feedback
- General questions

When raising a support request, please select the appropriate issue template on
[GitHub](https://github.com/1771-Technologies/lytenyte). Each template includes
specific guidance to help you provide the information we need to assist you effectively.

Our development team actively monitors all submissions. We aim to respond
to each issue, but response times may vary as priority is given to
LyteNyte Grid PRO license holders, who are guaranteed responses under their support agreements.

<Note>

**PRO users** receive 12 months of dedicated technical support with each purchase or renewal of their LyteNyte
Grid license plan. Active PRO license holders should include their customer ID and license plan when
raising a GitHub issue to enable priority handling and a guaranteed 24-hour response.

</Note>

## Email Support

Email support is a dedicated channel for active PRO license holders who need
confidential technical assistance, especially for issues not suited to the public GitHub repository.

Contact us at [support@1771technologies.com](mailto:support@1771technologies.com)
and include your company name, customer ID, and license plan to receive priority handling.

## Client Portal

PRO users gain exclusive access to the 1771 [client portal](https://www.1771technologies.com/admin).
In the portal, they can:

- **Manage licenses** by reviewing, updating, and staying on top of license details.
- **Filter GitHub issues** raised by their team for easier tracking.
- **Submit confidential issues** not suited to public GitHub reporting.
