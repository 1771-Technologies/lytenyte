title: Getting Started
description:
  Get started with LyteNyte Grid, a modern React data grid designed for enterprise-scale data challenges.
  Built in React, for React, it enables developers to ship faster and more efficiently than ever before.

  No wrappers. No dependencies. Open code.

## Our Motivation

Before LyteNyte Grid, we were trapped in a cycle of frustration with bloated, brittle,
and bizarrely over-engineered data grid libraries. Every new project
became a ritual of fighting APIs that felt like they were written by a
committee that never used React.

Here's what we kept running into again and again:

- **Customization was a nightmare.** Clunky, opaque APIs made even basic tweaks feel like defusing
  a bomb. Two-way data bindings, sync issues between React and the grid... we've seen things.

- **Server data loading was a disaster.** Optimistic updates, partial rendering, and caching
  never worked properly, or worse, worked sometimes, which is somehow more dangerous.

- **Performance collapsed under pressure.** Beyond trivial datasets, most grids fell apart.
  Virtualization failed. Re-renders multiplied. Main thread got blocked. Users rage-quit.

- **Breaking changes broke more than code.** New versions came with surprises, and not the
  fun kind. We were refactoring the same grid logic every quarter just to stay afloat.

- **Styling was their way or no way.** We were forced to adopt unfamiliar styling systems
  just to make things look half-decent, adding yet another layer of complexity.

- **Bundle sizes were obscene.** Grid libraries ballooned app load times by 1-3
  seconds. That's not just technical debt; it's user abandonment in disguise.

So‚Ä¶ We patched, duct-taped, forked, and cursed. Over time, our quick fixes turned into long-term liabilities.
Technical debt grew. Dev velocity dropped. Maintenance costs soared.
All because the tools we relied on couldn't keep up.

We built **LyteNyte Grid** to end that cycle.

## Why LyteNyte Grid Stands Out

At the heart of LyteNyte Grid is a commitment to the developer and user experience
based on the principle of 'seamless simplicity.'

Here's why we stand out:

- ‚öõÔ∏è **Clean, Declarative API:** LyteNyte Grid exposes a minimal, declarative API aligned with
  React's data flow and state model. No wrappers, no adapter layers.
  No awkward integrations, only cleaner, more maintainable code.

- üì¶ **Tiny Bundle Size:** Core edition is a tiny **36kb gzipped**, while the PRO edition weighs
  only **49kb gzipped**, so you no longer have to choose between advanced
  functionality and a fast user experience.

- ‚ö° **Unrivaled Speed:** LyteNyte can handle **10,000+ updates per second** and render millions of rows.
  Our reactive state architecture means performance doesn't degrade when paginating,
  filtering, or pulling from the server.

- üß© **Headless by Design, Components Included:** An industry first. Ultimate flexibility to choose
  between our pre-styled themes or drop into full headless mode for 100% control.
  Covering any use case you may have for a data table.

- üè¢ **Feature-Rich, Enterprise Ready:** Handles the most demanding workflows with a
  comprehensive feature set that includes pivot tables, tree data, server-side loading,
  custom cell rendering, rich cell editing, and more, all from a single package, giving
  you one consistent API to build with.

- ü´∂ **Simple Licensing, Transparent Support:** Straightforward licensing that won't
  leave you guessing what's permissible. All support is handled publicly on
  GitHub, giving you complete transparency into our response times.

## Core Edition vs. PRO Edition

LyteNyte Grid is available in two editions: **Core** and **PRO**.

LyteNyte Grid PRO is built on top of LyteNyte Grid Core, meaning it includes all Core features plus additional
advanced capabilities for the most demanding enterprise use cases. This architecture
ensures a seamless upgrade path; you can start with Core and switch to PRO
later without refactoring, as it's a non-breaking, drop-in replacement.

- **LyteNyte Core Edition:** Free, open source ([Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)),
  and genuinely useful. Includes essential features such as sorting, filtering, row grouping, column auto-sizing,
  detail views, data exporting, and others.

- **LyteNyte Grid PRO Edition:** A commercial edition ([EULA](https://www.1771technologies.com/eula))
  with advanced capabilities like server data loading, column and filter manager components,
  tree data, column pivoting, and more sophisticated data table tools.

To determine if a feature is exclusively part of the PRO edition,
look for the <ProTag /> icon next to the feature name on the navigation bar.
