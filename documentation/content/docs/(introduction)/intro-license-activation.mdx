LyteNyte Grid is available under the following license plans, based on the production edition.

**Core Edition**

- **Core License Plan:** Free, open-source ([Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0))
  license ideal for individual developers and community projects that need essential grid features.

**Pro Edition**

- **Developer PRO License Plan:** A [commercial license](https://www.1771technologies.com/eula)
  designed for individuals and teams with up to 50 developers. Unlocks the full potential
  of LyteNyte Grid with advanced features unavailable in the Core edition.

- **Organization PRO License Plan:** A [commercial license](https://www.1771technologies.com/eula)
  tailored for teams with 50+ developers. Includes everything in the Developer PRO plan plus enhanced SLAs, a
  dedicated relationship manager, and negotiated pricing terms.

After purchasing a PRO license plan, you'll receive an email containing your license
key, which you can also view at any time through the [client portal](https://www.1771technologies.com/sign-in).

This guide explains how to activate your license to prevent watermarks
from appearing when using the PRO edition in your web applications.

For a detailed comparison of license plans or to
purchase a license, please visit our [pricing page](https://www.1771technologies.com/pricing).

## Activation

Activate your license by calling the `activateLicense` function before
using LyteNyte Grid in your web application:

```ts
import { activateLicense } from "@1771technologies/lytenyte-pro";

activateLicense("<your-license-key-here>");
```

The `activateLicense` function is lightweight and can be called many times. If your application has
multiple potential entry points, calling `activateLicense` for each entry point is perfectly fine.

## Validation Process

We validate your license key to ensure compliance with the LyteNyte Grid PRO
End User License Agreement ([EULA](https://www.1771technologies.com/eula)).
Although each developer active in the front-end code must be licensed, the key
only needs to be set once per project where LyteNyte Grid is used.

The `activateLicense` function validates your license key using the encoded
information and the internal build date of the LyteNyte Grid code.
This validation happens completely offline without any external network requests.

## Validation Failures

If your license key is missing, invalid, or expired, LyteNyte Grid shows a
notification warning indicating that a valid license key is required.

If you see a watermark despite having a valid license key or cannot
retrieve your license key, please get in touch with us at
[account-help@1771technologies.com](mailto:account-help@1771technologies.com).

Here are the various possible validation errors:

### Missing License Key

_“LyteNyte Grid PRO is being used for evaluation. Click here to secure your license.”_

This notification appears when no license key has been set, or when evaluating
LyteNyte Grid PRO without a valid license.

### Invalid License Key

_“Invalid license key. Please verify the key and try again.”_

This notification indicates that your PRO license key is invalid.
It could be due to a typo or a missing character in the key.

To resolve this issue, verify that your license key is entered correctly.
For detailed steps, refer to the [Installation guide](/docs/intro-installation).

### Expired License Key

_“License key expired. Your license covers earlier versions only.”_

This notification indicates that your PRO license key is valid,
but it doesn't cover the version of LyteNyte Grid PRO you're using.

PRO licenses are perpetual but only apply to versions released
during your active license term. To use this version, you'll need to renew your license.
