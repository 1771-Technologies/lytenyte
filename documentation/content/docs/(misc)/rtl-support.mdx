description: Enable Right-to-Left (RTL) rendering in LyteNyte Grid with a single
  configuration change.
---

LyteNyte Grid fully supports Right-to-Left (RTL) rendering.
Enable it by setting the `rtl` property on the grid state.

<Callout>

LyteNyte Grid uses [logical CSS properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_logical_properties_and_values)
throughout its codebase. This ensures RTL works seamlessly without extra styling changes.
You only need to set the `rtl` flag-no additional configuration is required.

</Callout>

Set the `rtl` flag directly on the grid. The grid will not detect RTL
based on the CSS `direction` of the viewport or any parent element.
