  editing, and touch interaction.
---

LyteNyte Grid supports extensive keyboard shortcuts to improve
navigation, editing, and accessibility. It follows the
[ARIA Grid Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/grid/) and
adds extra keybindings for power users. Read the ARIA pattern first,
then use this guide for LyteNyte-specific bindings.

## Navigation

Use the arrow keys (`←`, `→`, `↑`, `↓`) to move between header and grid
cells. The `Tab` key follows natural DOM order, but LyteNyte treats the grid as
a **single tab stop**. This prevents users from having to tab through every cell.

```
Ctrl → : Jump to the last cell in the current row or header
Ctrl ← : Jump to the first cell in the current row or header
Ctrl ↑ : Focus the first row (when on a grid cell)
Ctrl ↓ : Focus the last row (when on a grid cell)
```

### Expanding Selection

When `cellSelectionMode` is set to `range`, hold `Shift` while pressing
`←`, `→`, `↑`, or `↓` to expand or shrink the active selection.

## Editable Cells

For editable cells (see [Cell Editing](/docs/cell-editing)):

- Press `Enter` to enter edit mode.
- Press `Enter` again to confirm and trigger `onCellEdit`.
- Press `Esc` to cancel and revert the value.

## Touch Interactions

LyteNyte Grid works seamlessly on touch devices.
Browser `click` events fire on tap, and the grid uses these events for
its interaction listeners.
