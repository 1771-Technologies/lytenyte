## `ColumnGroupMeta`<span className="type-tag" style={{ '--type-content': "'object'" }} />

Provides metadata related to column groups in LyteNyte Grid.

This metadata is auto-generated by the grid based on the configured column definitions.
It is used internally to manage layout and grouping behavior, but is also exposed for
advanced use cases where programmatic interaction with group structures is needed.
