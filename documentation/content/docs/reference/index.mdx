grid. These interfaces are the most commonly used. These are:

- [Grid State Reference](/docs/reference/grid-state#gridstate): provides technical coverage of the
  grid state properties of LyteNyte Grid. State is the main driver in LyteNyte Grid as the majority of the
  API is declarative.
- [Grid API Reference](/docs/reference/grid-api#gridapi): guidance on using the imperative methods LyteNyte Grid
  provides to make managing the declarative API easier, and and overview of the convenience methods that extend the
  power and functionality of LyteNyte Grid.
- [Grid Events](/docs/reference/events#gridevents): a detailed overview of all the events emitted by LyteNyte Grid, including event types,
  payload structures, and recommended usage scenarios.

## Using LyteNyte Grid's API

Each instance of LyteNyte Grid get's its own reference to the grid state and API. Creating an
instance is done through the `useLyteNyte` hook:

```ts
const grid = useLyteNyte({ ... })
```

The _ts`grid`_ reference is the main access point to the LyteNyte Grid API:
