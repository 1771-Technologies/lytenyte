          /** 
           * A function that computes the row or column span for a given cell in LyteNyte Grid.
 * 
 * This function supports both row and column spanning, depending on where it's applied. It must
 * return a numeric value greater than or equal to  ''1'' , indicating how many rows or columns
 * the cell should span.
 * 
 * **Performance Note**: This function is called frequently during layout calculations,
 * so it must be fast and efficient to avoid UI lag.
 * 
 * **Consistency Requirement**:
 * 
 * LyteNyte Grid expects spans to be logically consistent and non-overlapping. For instance,
 * if a cell at row index 0 returns a span of 3, then the cells at row indices 1 and 2 must
 * return a span of 1 (i.e. not spanned), as they are covered by the span starting at row 0.
 * 
 * Inconsistent or overlapping span calculations may cause layout breakage due to LyteNyte's
 * look-back layout resolution strategy.
 * 
 * **Scan Distance**:
 * 
 * Use the grid's  ''rowScanDistance''  and  ''colScanDistance''  properties to define how far
 * the grid should look when resolving spans. These act as guarantees that no span will exceed
 * the specified limits.
 * 
 * **Visibility**:
 * 
 * Cells that are spanned over (i.e. covered by another cell's span) will not be rendered and
 * are excluded from the layout and DOM. Ensure your span logic accounts for this behavior.

## `CellSpanFnParams`<span className="type-tag" style={{ '--type-content': "'object'" }} />

Input parameters for  [CellSpanFn](/docs/reference/row-and-column-spanning#CellSpanFn) , which determines the span of a given cell.

These parameters include:
- The grid instance
- Row and column indices
- The row node representing the full row data

Used to compute dynamic row or column spans for advanced layout use cases.
