          /**
           * A function that computes the row or column span for a given cell in LyteNyte Grid.

-
- This function supports both row and column spanning, depending on where it's applied. It must
- return a numeric value greater than or equal to ''1'' , indicating how many rows or columns
- the cell should span.
-
- **Performance Note**: This function is called frequently during layout calculations,
- so it must be fast and efficient to avoid UI lag.
-
- **Consistency Requirement**:
-
- LyteNyte Grid expects spans to be logically consistent and non-overlapping. For instance,
- if a cell at row index 0 returns a span of 3, then the cells at row indices 1 and 2 must
- return a span of 1 (i.e. not spanned), as they are covered by the span starting at row 0.
-
- Inconsistent or overlapping span calculations may cause layout breakage due to LyteNyte's
- look-back layout resolution strategy.
-
- **Scan Distance**:
-
- Use the grid's ''rowScanDistance'' and ''colScanDistance'' properties to define how far
- the grid should look when resolving spans. These act as guarantees that no span will exceed
- the specified limits.
-
- **Visibility**:
-
- Cells that are spanned over (i.e. covered by another cell's span) will not be rendered and
- are excluded from the layout and DOM. Ensure your span logic accounts for this behavior.

## `CellSpanFnParams`<span className="type-tag" style={{ '--type-content': "'object'" }} />

Input parameters for [CellSpanFn](/docs/reference/row-and-column-spanning#cellspanfn) , which determines the span of a given cell.

These parameters include:

- The grid instance
- Row and column indices
- The row node representing the full row data

Used to compute dynamic row or column spans for advanced layout use cases.
