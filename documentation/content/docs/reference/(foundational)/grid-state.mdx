## `Grid`<span className="type-tag" style={{ '--type-content': "'object'" }} />

It is returned by the `useLyteNyte` hook and serves as the primary interface for interacting with the grid programmatically.

## `GridState`<span className="type-tag" style={{ '--type-content': "'object'" }} />

grid properties that affect layout, data, selection, and rendering. Updating any of these atoms will trigger
corresponding changes in the grid UI. These state values can also be used to create and synchronize external
components such as toolbars, panels, or widgets.
