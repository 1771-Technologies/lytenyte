## v0.9.4 Server Data Source Reset

<DateTag>v0.9.4 - June 30, 2025</DateTag>

v0.9.4 addresses an issue where changes to column definitions incorrectly triggered a reset of the loaded
row data in the server-side data source. This behavior stemmed from LyteNyte Grid validating the sort
and filter models during column updates, which led the server data source to mistakenly interpret these validations as
model changes. As a result, it unnecessarily reloaded the row data. v0.9.4 fixes the issue,
row data will now only be reset when the sort or filter models have actually changed.

## v0.9.3 Turbopack CSS fix

<DateTag>v0.9.3 - June 27, 2025</DateTag>

v0.9.3 resolves CSS selector compatibility issues to enable proper bundling
with Turbopack, ensuring seamless integration with Next.js applications.

## v0.9.2 Minor Performance Enhancement

<DateTag>v0.9.2 - June 26, 2025</DateTag>

v0.9.2 improves internal caching optimizations for grid field calculations.
While these improvements aren't visible to users, they make LyteNyte
Grid more responsive and efficient under the hood.

## v0.9.1 Fixing Safari

<DateTag>v0.9.1 - June 19, 2025</DateTag>

v0.9.1 resolves a browser-specific repaint issue that occurred only in the Safari browser on macOS.
Previously, when hovering over rows in the LyteNyte Grid, the highlight effect was applied by
modifying a `<style/>` element.

In Safari, this caused the entire grid to repaint instead of just the affected rows.
This has now been corrected: the hover highlight is applied directly to each cell's
style attribute and removed when the hover ends, preventing unnecessary full-grid repaints.
