  data loading solution that feels instant. This guide explains how to
  optimistically load rows so users never encounter a loading indicator.

## Optimistically Fetching Data Slices

Optimistic data loading is not a one-size-fits-all strategy. Instead,
it's about predicting which data a user is likely to view next and preparing it in advance.
This approach is common on webpages, where links to other pages are preloaded to speed
up navigation. We can apply the same principle to loading data slices.

Before looking at examples, note that optimistic loading is not a fixed sequence
of functions. The best approach depends on your application and how users interact
with it. The examples in this guide introduce common use cases and
demonstrate how LyteNyte Grid supports optimistic data loading.

The example below demonstrates how to optimistically load slices in a flat data view.
This works by tracking the current view and preloading the next slice whenever the
view changes. This way, the grid “stays ahead of the scroll.” Note that this does
not guarantee users will never see a loading indicator. Scrolling is fast, and if users
scroll too quickly, the grid may not have finished fetching rows before they become visible.

In the example above, optimistic loading occurs within a single `useEffect`, but it uses several parts of the
server data source interface. The full effect is shown and explained here, but check out the
[`RowDataSourceServer` reference](/docs/reference/row-data-source#rowdatasourceserver) for a complete breakdown
of the methods available on the server data source.

```ts
useEffect(() => {
  // Watch for view changes to track the current requests that define the view.
  return ds.requestsForView.watch(() => {
    // When the view changes, grab the next view value using the atom's get method.
    // Since this grid is flat, take the last item in the view.
    const view = ds.requestsForView.get().at(-1);
    if (!view) return;

    // Compute the next slice for this view. Returns null if the current view is the last one.
    const next = ds.requestForNextSlice(view);
    if (!next || ds.seenRequests.has(next.id)) return;

    // Mark this request as seen so the grid doesn’t refetch it when scrolled into view.
    // This step is optional but helps LyteNyte Grid track requested data.
    ds.seenRequests.add(next.id);

    // Push the new request into the grid. This triggers LyteNyte Grid to fetch the data.
    ds.pushRequests([next]);
  });
}, [ds]);
```

Notice how multiple parts of the data source API work together to create an optimistic data loading
pattern. LyteNyte Grid's API for optimistic loading is intentionally low-level, allowing developers to
tailor the behavior to their specific use case.

## Optimistically Fetching Group Rows

Another way to optimistically fetch rows is when row groups are present. Before the user
expands a group, you can fetch its data in advance. A convenient approach is to detect
when a row is hovered by the user's mouse cursor and then fetch the data for that
row's children. The example below demonstrates this:

!demo:Preload Group Rows On Hover="./demos/optimistic-loading-groups"

Preloading on hover is just one approach. You could also preload on load or when a cell
gains focus. The core concept remains the same: before the user requests
the data, the grid predicts that they'll want to expand the row and loads it ahead of time.

The code for preloading rows is even simpler than for optimistically fetching rows while scrolling:

```tsx
<Grid.Row
  onMouseEnter={() => {
    const req = ds.requestForGroup(row.rowIndex);
    if (!req || ds.seenRequests.has(req.id)) return;

    // Preload the row group
    ds.seenRequests.add(req.id);
    ds.pushRequests([req]);
  }}
>
  {...}
</Grid.Row>
```

The code above uses another server data source method, `requestForGroup`. This
method returns a `DataRequest` object that can be used to request the child
rows of a group, allowing you to preload them in advance.
