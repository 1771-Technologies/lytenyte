title: Unbalanced Rows (Tree Data)
description: Hierarchical data may include leaf rows at varying depths, which
  is especially common in NoSQL databases. LyteNyte Grid supports
  representing these unbalanced hierarchies and can load them from a server source on demand.

## Display A Tree of Data

When using LyteNyte Grid's server data source, it's important to understand that the grid
view reflects the rows received from the serverâ€”not the models defined in the grid
state. For example, if the [row group model](/docs/server-data-loading-row-grouping-and-aggregations)
defines four grouping levels, LyteNyte Grid does not enforce that each row must be
expandable four times to reach a leaf node.

This means the server data source can display tree data of any depth, as long as
the server's data representation is consistent with the responses sent to the client.

The example below demonstrates this by creating a tree with varying branch levels.
It does so without using row groups, though the same logic and pattern apply.

!demo:Unbalanced Rows="./demos/unbalanced-rows"

In this example, a file viewer is implemented without leveraging LyteNyte Grid's
`rowGroupModel`. The grid still tracks expansions using the `rowGroupExpansions` state property.

This is just one example of handling unbalanced rows. Another common use case is collapsing row
groups that contain only a single child. The key takeaway is that LyteNyte Grid respects
the rows returned by the server over the grid's internal state. The server is responsible
for interpreting state, and the grid simply renders what the server provides.

### Considerations

LyteNyte Grid's server data source automatically responds to changes in the grid's models.
When these models change, the data source resets itself. In the example above,
groups are created without using the row group model, so if the group data
changes, it's the developer's responsibility to reset the data source.
This can be done using the `reset` method on the server data source:

```ts
const ds = useServerDataSource<any>({...});

// In an effect or whenever the view should reset
ds.reset()
```
