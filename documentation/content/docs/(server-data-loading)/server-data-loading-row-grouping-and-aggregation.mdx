title: Row Grouping and Aggregation
description: Group rows on the server to display hierarchical data in the
  grid's viewport. LyteNyte Grid's server data source requests grouped slices
  and assembles the view to match the data structure.

## Grouping Rows

LyteNyte Grid represents row groups using the `rowGroupModel` property on the grid state.
The presence of row groups results in hierarchical structure of rows with a parent child
relationship being established.

Whilst LyteNyte Grid maintains the model state, the server is responsible for returning rows for
the given grouping and hierarchical structure. When row groups are present, LyteNyte Grid's server
row data source will make requests that have a `path` property that indicates the row group slice that
is being requested. A simplified example is shown below, but if you are unfamiliar with the
data request interface read our [dedicated data interface guide](/docs/server-data-loading-interface).

!demo:Row Grouping="./demos/row-grouping-basic"

This basic grouping example does not include aggregations (which will be covered in the next section), so only
the leaf level rows will have data values. Furthermore, if you inspect the `server.ts` file of the demo (by clicking
the **Expand Code** button), you will notice that row groups are more complex to compute than flat rows. The extra
dimension of parent/child relationships means each part of the visual representation of the view becomes
more complex.
