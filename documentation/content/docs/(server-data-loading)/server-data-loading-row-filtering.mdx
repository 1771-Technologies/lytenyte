title: Row Filtering
description: LyteNyte Grid defines various filter models that the server data source may leverage to
  filter rows on the server. The server may also define a custom filter model it define its own
  filter functionality and behavior.
---

## Different Filter Models Available

LyteNyte Grid defines different filter models that the server may leverage to remove some rows from
its responses to the client. These are:

- [Filter Model](/docs/reference/filters#filtermodelitem): standard column filters that directly apply
  a predicate to the value of cells for a given column. These filter test logical operations such as determining
  greater than or less than values.
- [Filter In Model](/docs/reference/filters#filterin): a tree set definition that may be used to determine
  inclusion or exclusion of values.
- [Quick search](/docs/filter-quick-filter): a string value that may be used to search
  across rows for any cell that matches the value.
- Custom: a developer defined model. This will not be present on the LyteNyte Grid state and is instead
  arbitrarily defined by developers. This model can be anything appropriate for the given application use cases.

## Filter Model Handling on the Server

The `filterModel` state on LyteNyte Grid's state object provides a definition of column filters that servers may
leverage to perform basic filtering. These models are provide functionality such as only returning the rows that
have a column whose cells are greater than a specific value. The example below demonstrates this by leveraging
the column filter component of LyteNyte Grid.

The filter implementation below only implements a subset of the full filter model supported by LyteNyte Grid.
This is done mainly for illustrative purposes. The filter operators of LyteNyte Grid's filter model are usually
directly support by most databases and developers should not find themselves implementing the complex logic
themselves.

The column filters support a wide variety of filter operators and options. Your server implementation may not need to support
the full range of filters that may be represented by the LyteNyte Grid `filterModel`. The example above, does not implement
every single filter possible.

### Filter Options

The individual column filters in the filter model may have some options applied. It is up to the server data source to
handle these options if necessary. For example, a string filter may be defined as follows:

```ts
{
  kind: "string",
  operator: "contains",
  value: "Star",
  options: {
    trimWhitespace: true
  }
}
```

Notice the `trimWhitespace` option is set to true. A server implementation would read this flag and remove the
surrounding whitespace from the filter values before determining the result of the filter predicate. LyteNyte Grid
allows for full flexibility on the server side for the interpretation of the filter options. A server implementation
may choose to ignore any options. LyteNyte Grid's server data source only expects rows to be returned for a given
response, hence anything that makes sense for the application use case may be returned from the server.

## The Filter In Model

The `filterInModel` of LyteNyte Grid allows for inclusion/exclusion testing for a given values in the cell.
These types of filters are also known as tree set filters, set filters, or in filters. The server has two
responsibilities when handling in filters:

1. Providing the possible filter values that a column may have. This is a list of unique values for a given
   column.
2. Filter rows in response to changes to the `filterInModel` state of the grid. LyteNyte Grid will inform the
   server when the model changes.

### Filter Values

The server data source accepts the `dataInFilterItemFetcher` callback, which is a function that should return
a `Promise` of the filter values for a given column. LyteNyte Grid will call this function when the in filter
values a requested for display.

The `dataInFilterItemFetcher` function will receive a set of params defined by
the [`DataInFilterItemFetcherParams`](/docs/reference/row-data-source#datainfilteritemfetcherparams) type interface.
