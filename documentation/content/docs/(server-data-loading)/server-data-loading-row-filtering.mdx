title: Row Filtering
description: LyteNyte Grid defines various filter models that the server data source may leverage to
  filter rows on the server. The server may also define a custom filter model it define its own
  filter functionality and behavior.
---

## Different Filter Models Available

LyteNyte Grid defines different filter models that the server may leverage to remove some rows from
its responses to the client. These are:

- [Filter Model](/docs/reference/filters#filtermodelitem): standard column filters that directly apply
  a predicate to the value of cells for a given column. These filter test logical operations such as determining
  greater than or less than values.
- [Filter In Model](/docs/reference/filters#filterin): a tree set definition that may be used to determine
  inclusion or exclusion of values.
- [Quick search](/docs/filter-quick-filter): a string value that may be used to search
  across rows for any cell that matches the value.
- Custom: a developer defined model. This will not be present on the LyteNyte Grid state and is instead
  arbitrarily defined by developers. This model can be anything appropriate for the given application use cases.

## Filter Model Handling on the Server

The `filterModel` state on LyteNyte Grid's state object provides a definition of column filters that servers may
leverage to perform basic filtering. These models are provide functionality such as only returning the rows that
have a column whose cells are greater than a specific value. The example below demonstrates this by leveraging
the column filter component of LyteNyte Grid.

The column filters support a wide variety of filter operators and options. Your server implementation may not need to support
the full range of filters that may be represented by the LyteNyte Grid `filterModel`. The example above, does not implement
every single filter possible.
