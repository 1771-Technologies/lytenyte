  The server row data source enables applications using LyteNyte Grid to retrieve and interact
  with data stored on the server.

The server data source is the most advanced and capable of all LyteNyte Grid
data sources. Partial data loading is necessary when the dataset contains hundreds
of thousands or even millions of rows.

## What Problem Does Server Data Loading Solve?

When the amount of row data exceeds what is feasible to transfer to a browser at once,
a partial data loading solution becomes necessary.

Developers typically choose one of these approaches:

- **Pagination**: load one page of data at a time.
- **Infinite scrolling**: lazily load more data as the user scrolls down.
- **Viewport-based loading**: load only the rows currently in view.

LyteNyte Grid supports all three approaches, but the Server Data Loading guides focus on
viewport-based loading. This approach is the most powerful and flexible but also the
most complex to implement. LyteNyte Grid handles the client-side code, so developers
only need to implement the server logic.

## Why Use Server Data Loading?

Server Data Loading allows direct interaction with any row in the dataset and provides
a consistent view. For example, if a user scrolls to row index 9,500, the grid retrieves
that data seamlessly. Operations like pivoting and grouping are natural with the server
data source but limited or unintuitive with pagination and infinite scrolling.
Server data loading aims to deliver a client-like experience, with the trade-off of
network latency.

## High-Level Overview

To enable the server data source, developers must provide LyteNyte Grid with:

- **Total row count**: determines the scrollable area size. When row grouping is used,
  group specific row counts are required. LyteNyte Grid assembles these counts into the
  full dataset.
- **`dataFetcher` function**: a function LyteNyte Grid calls to fetch rows from your server.

## Data Flow

The server data source follows a well defined lifecycle:

<Steps>
<Step>

### Initial Data Fetch

When the grid first renders, LyteNyte Grid calls the `dataFetcher` function with an initial
request payload. At this stage, LyteNyte Grid has no cached view data. The initial response
provides the `rowCount` and the first rows to display.

</Step>

<Step>

### User Scrolls (View Changes)

LyteNyte Grid tracks which rows are visible. When the view changes, it determines whether
to request more data from the server. If necessary, multiple requests may be issued.

### Actions That Reset the View

Some actions require a full view reset and fresh data from the server. This occurs when
users sort a column or group rows, as these operations alter the dataset view.

All other operations extend this basic flow. LyteNyte Grid's server data source is advanced
and supports many extensions. The simplest example of a server data loading grid is shown
below. Read the guides in this section for in depth coverage:
