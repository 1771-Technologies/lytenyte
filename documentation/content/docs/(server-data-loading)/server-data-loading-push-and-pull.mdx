title: Data Pushing or Pulling
description: The LyteNyte Grid's server data source enables programmatic data exchange
  with the server, giving developers full control over how data is loaded into the
  grid. It also supports hybrid patterns where row data originates from both the
  client and the server.
---

## Pulling Data

LyteNyte Grid provides the `pushRequests` method on the server data source to request (**"pull"**) data
from the server. When invoked, the grid processes the requests as new, ignoring existing request
tracking. The grid also manages row data conflict resolution and cancels pending requests
if the grid resets before a response is received.

In the example below, clicking the **"Request Data"** button triggers the
grid to tickâ€”a manual refresh similar to those in many UIs that let users poll for updates.

!demo:Data Pulling="./demos/data-pulling"

The code for pulling data from the server is simple and runs in
the **"Request Data"** button's `onClick` callback:

```tsx
<button
  onClick={() => {
    ds.pushRequests(ds.requestsForView.get());
  }}
>
  Request Data
</button>
```

We use the `requestsForView` atom to fetch requests for the current view, though any
request set can be used. If you're unfamiliar with the request interface,
see the [data interface guide](/docs/server-data-loading-interface) for more details.

## Pushing Data

You can push data into LyteNyte Grid using the `pushResponses` method on the
server data source. This method accepts complete data responses and sends
them to the server. It can also be used to generate data ticks on the client,
as shown in the example below.

!demo:Data Pushing="./demos/data-pushing"

This example is intentionally simple to highlight the core functionality. Like
the data-pulling example, the main logic runs in the **"Push Data"** button's `onClick`
handler. However, instead of calling `pushRequests`, it calls `pushResponses`
and provides complete responses.

```tsx
<button
  onClick={() => {
    const res = getResponses(
      ds.requestsForView.get(),
      grid.state.rowGroupModel.get(),
      grid.state.aggModel.get(),
    );
    ds.pushResponses(res);
  }}
>
  Push Data
</button>
```

Pushing responses requires a solid understanding of the LyteNyte Grid server
data source's response model and how responses form the data tree.
See the [data interface guide](/docs/server-data-loading-interface) for more information.
