title: Cell Editing Server Data
pro: true
description: You can edit server-side data through the LyteNyte Grid server data source.
  This allows updating cell values and synchronizing those updates with the server.

This guide assumes familiarity with LyteNyte Grid's cell editing capabilities. If not,
see the [Cell Editing guide](/docs/cell-editing). The content here focuses on
handling cell updates through the server data source.

## Editing Data

LyteNyte Grid's `useServerDataSource` hook accepts a callback for the `cellUpdateHandler` property.
This handler is called when a cell edit occurs in the grid and is responsible for sending the update
request to the server. It runs asynchronously, and once the update completes, it's the
developer's responsibility to refresh the grid data, typically by calling the server data source's `refresh` method.

The example below demonstrates this. You can edit any cell value (by double clicking on the cell); after committing the change, it won't
update immediately but will refresh shortly to show the new value. This behavior isn't ideal,
which is why the next section explains how to optimistically update the client value so changes appear instantly.

!demo:Edit Data Async="./demos/editing-server-data"

The example implements a basic update handler. In most cases, your update
logic should look similar to the following:

```ts
cellUpdateHandler: async (updates) => {
  // send update to server
  await handleUpdate(updates);

  // refresh after the update
  ds.refresh();
};
```

### Optimistic Update For Instant Feedback

The example above isn't ideal form many use cases. The main issue is that cell updates aren't reflected
immediately. LyteNyte Grid's server data source provides an optimistic update flag that
applies cell updates directly on the client. Enabling this flag assumes the
server update will succeed. The `cellUpdateOptimistically` property makes cell updates apply
instantly on the client, but remember that this change is client only. Developers
must still implement the `cellUpdateHandler` function and handle any errors that occur when sending updates to the server.

!demo:Edit Data Async With Optimistic Updates="./demos/editing-server-data-optimistic"

With optimistic updates enabled, you can skip the refresh step if the applied update
matches the expected server value. The server update logic now looks similar to:

```ts
cellUpdateHandler: async (updates) => {
  // send update to server
  await handleUpdate(updates);
},
cellUpdateOptimistically: true,
```
