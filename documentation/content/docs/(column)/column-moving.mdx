title: Column Moving
description: Columns in LyteNyte Grid may be reordered programmatically or through the grid's
  drag and drop header functionality. Additionally column groups may be used to reorder sets
  of columns at the same.

## Move By Dragging

LyteNyte Grid's columns support drag reordering through the `uiHints` property on the column specification. By
setting `movable` to `true`, a column's header by be dragged into a new position. The demo demonstrates this. Try
dragging a header into a new position:

!demo:Move By Dragging="./demos/column-moving_x"

The demo above enables column moving for all columns by setting the `movable` property on the base column:

```ts
const grid = Grid.useLyteNyte({
  // Other grid props
  columnBase: {
    uiHints: {
      movable: true,
    },
  },
});
```

### Pin Columns & Drag Reordering

For a given column configuration some columns may be pinned, whilst others are scrollable. When reordering columns
by dragging them, if a column that is not pinned is dragged over a pinned column, then in addition to moving it will
be pinned. Likewise, if a pinned column is moved over a column that is not pinned, it will be reordered and unpinned.
The demo below demonstrates this behavior:

!demo:Moving Pinned Columns="./demos/column-moving-pinned_x"

## Move By Dragging Column Groups

Columns that are part of the same group may be reordered together. For a column group to be orderable by dragging all
the columns in the group must be movable. The demo below shows this in action. Try dragging the **Inventory** group,
and notice how the **ID** and **Product** column are both moved.

!demo:Moving Column Groups="./demos/column-moving-group_x"

## Programmatic Column Reordering

The `api.columnMove` method on the LyteNyte Grid API may be used to programmatically reorder columns. The order of
columns in LyteNyte Grid is determined by the order of the columns in the grid state. The `api.columnMove` is
a utility method that will reorder the `grid.state.columns` value. Calling `api.columnMove` will result in a
column state update. For example the following code would swap the **ID** and **Product** columns:

```ts
grid.api.columnMove({ moveColumns: ["product"], moveTarget: "id", before: false });
```

For more details on the `api.columnMove` method see the [Grid API reference](docs/reference/grid-api#gridapi).
