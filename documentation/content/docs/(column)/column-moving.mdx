description: Guide to reordering columns and column groups in LyteNyte Grid
---

LyteNyte Grid lets you reorder columns. Users can drag and drop columns
or use UI components provided by the grid.

To reorder a column, click and drag its header to a new position. While
dragging, the grid shows a drag indicator and placeholder to indicate
the potential new position.

Set the movable UI hint on a column to allow header dragging:

```ts
uiHints: {
  movable: true,
}
```

Dragging a non-pinned column over a pinned column pins it. Dragging a
pinned column over a non-pinned column unpins it.

## Moving Column Groups

A column group is movable only when all columns in it are movable. If
any column in the group is not movable, the entire group becomes
unmovable. You can still move any individual movable columns inside the
group.
