title: Column Moving
description: Columns in LyteNyte Grid may be reordered programmatically or through the
  grid's drag-and-drop header interactions. Column groups can also be reordered as a unit.

## Move By Dragging

LyteNyte Grid supports column reordering through the `uiHints` property on each
column definition. Set `movable` to `true` to allow users to drag a column
header to a new position. Try dragging a header in the demo below:

!demo:Move By Dragging="./demos/column-moving_x"

The demo enables moving for all columns by setting `movable` on the base column:

```ts
const grid = Grid.useLyteNyte({
  // Other grid props
  columnBase: {
    uiHints: {
      movable: true,
    },
  },
});
```

### Pin Columns & Drag Reordering

When some columns are pinned and others columns are scrollable, drag reordering also updates
pinning. Dragging an unpinned column over a pinned one pins the moved
column. Dragging a pinned column over an unpinned column unpins it. The demo below shows this behavior:

!demo:Moving Pinned Columns="./demos/column-moving-pinned_x"

## Move By Dragging Column Groups

Columns in the same group can be dragged together. All columns in the group must
be movable for group dragging to work. In the demo below,
dragging the **Inventory** group moves both the **ID** and **Product** columns:

!demo:Moving Column Groups="./demos/column-moving-group_x"

## Programmatic Column Reordering

Use `api.columnMove` to reorder columns programmatically. Column order is determined
by the sequence of columns in the grid state, and `api.columnMove`
updates `grid.state.columns` accordingly. For example, the code
below swaps the **ID** and **Product** columns:

```ts
grid.api.columnMove({ moveColumns: ["product"], moveTarget: "id", before: false });
```
