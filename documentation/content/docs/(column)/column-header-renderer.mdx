title: Column Header Renderer
description: Every column may define a unique header renderer to determine the
  content that should be displayed in the header cell. A header renderer is a
  custom React component that LyteNyte Grid will use to create the element for the
  header.
---

There are two ways to create a header renderer in LyteNyte Grid. Both ways make
use of the `headerRenderer` property on the [column](/docs/reference/column#column)
specification.

- By providing a function that returns a `ReactNode` to the `headerRenderer` property.
- A string which represents a key lookup into a set of registered header renderer components.

This guide will cover both approaches, and provide some guidance on when to consider one approach
over the other.

## Header Function Renderers

Creating a function header renderer is as simple as:

1. Defining a custom React component function that accepts an object of type
   [`HeaderCellRendererParams`](docs/reference/column-header#headercellrendererparams) as props.
2. Setting the value of the `headerRenderer` property on a column that should use this renderer.

The demo below demonstrates this in action. Every column has a custom `headerRenderer` which will add
an icon based on the column ID.

!demo:Function Header Renderers="./demos/column-header-renderer_x"

The header renderer in the demo is a normal React component. It is rendered within the same React
tree as the rest of your React application. This means that the renderer will have access to React
context and any React hooks may be used within the header renderer.

## Registered Header Renderers

LyteNyte Grid has a header renderer registry for each grid instance. The `headerCellRenderers` property
on the grid state is used to register a specific render for a given key. Columns in the grid may then
reference the registered by the key. Whilst there is a little bit more boilerplate to use registered
header renderers, this approach has two key advantages:

- The column specifications remain serializable. Since the column specification does not have a function,
  it may be serialized to JSON safely.
- Renderers can be registered in advance and the switched without creating new functions for different
  renderers.

In the demo below, each column will use a registered header renderer with the key `header-with-icon`.
The result is the same as the function renderers but the approach is different.

!demo:Registered Header Renderers="./demos/column-header-renderer-registration_x"

The code for using the registered renders is straightforward. Define your header component,
register it on the `headerCellRenderers` property, and then reference the renderer by the
registered key. The code in the demo that does this is shown below:

```ts
const grid = Grid.useLyteNyte({
  // Other props
  headerCellRenderers: {
    "header-with-icon": HeaderWithIcon,
  },
  columnBase: {
    headerRenderer: "header-with-icon",
  },
});
```

## Registered Or Function

Providing a direction header renderer function or registering the function then referencing
it by key are both able to achieve the same result. The question then arises which approach
to prefer. Either will work for any use case, but it is recommended to use the function
approach when:

- The use case is simple and does not require updates to columns.
- Header renderers are created and set on columns dynamically, i.e. at runtime.

For other cases prefer registering a header renderer ahead of time. This is especially
true when:

- Columns are defined on the server and fetched before displaying the grid.
- There are a lot of columns in the grid that share similar renderers.
- The columns provided to LyteNyte Grid need to be serializable.

## Next Steps

- [Column Resizing](/docs/column-resizing): Change column widths programmatically or via user interaction.
- [Column ID & Name](/docs/column-header-name): Define user-friendly column names and ensure unique IDs.
- [Column Moving](/docs/column-moving): Reorder columns programmatically or through drag-and-drop.
- [Column Field](/docs/column-field): Control how a column retrieves its value for each cell.
