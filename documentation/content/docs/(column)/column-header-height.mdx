title: Column Header Height
description: LyteNyte Grid lets you customize header height flexibly. The header can
  contain three components, column groups rows, a column header row, and a floating header row.
---

Column group rows appear only when you organize columns into groups. The
floating header row appears only when you set the `floatingRowEnabled`
property to `true`.

## Column Header Height

Set the column header height with the `headerHeight` property. Pass a
`number` value representing the height in pixels.

!demo:Column Header Height="./demos/column-header-height"

You can change the column header height after setup:

```ts
// Set the header height to 24px
grid.state.headerHeight.set(24);
```

### Column Headers Span Column Group Rows

When using column groups, some columns might not belong to any group or
might belong to groups with fewer levels than the deepest group. In such
cases, the column header spans multiple group rows, increasing its
height based on the rows spanned.

## Column Group Header Height

Use the `headerGroupHeight` property to set the height of each column
group header row. Column groups can form multi-level hierarchies.

!demo:Column Group Header Height="./demos/column-header-group-height"

You can change the column group header height by updating the
`headerGroupHeight` state:

```ts
// Set the column group header height to 30px
grid.state.headerGroupHeight.set(30);
```

## Floating Row Height

The floating row appears as an extra header row under the column header.
It's useful for showing supplementary info or interactive components
like floating filters. Use the `floatingRowHeight` property to set its
height.

!demo:Floating Row Height="./demos/column-header-floating-row-height"

You can also update the floating row height dynamically:

```ts
// Set the floating row height to 24px
grid.state.floatingRowHeight.set(24);
```
