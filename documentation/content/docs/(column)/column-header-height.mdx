title: Column Header Height
description: LyteNyte Grid lets you customize header height flexibly. The header's total height
  comes from the combined height of column group headers, column headers, and floating headers.

## Column Header Height

Use the `headerHeight` property on the grid state to set the height of the header row in pixels.
The demo below shows how it works, including programmatic updates.

!demo:Column Header Height="./demos/column-header-height_x"

### Column Headers Span Column Group Rows

When column groups are enabled, some columns may not belong to a group or may belong to a group
with fewer levels than the deepest group. These columns span multiple group rows, which increases
their header height.

In the demo below, the **Price** and **Product** columns belong to the **Inventory** group.
The remaining columns span the full header height. A header cell's final height equals the base
header height plus the height of any group rows it spans.

!demo:Column Header Group Span="./demos/column-header-height-spans_x"

The demo updates the header height programmatically by setting the `headerHeight` state:

```ts
grid.state.headerHeight.set(60);
```

## Column Group Header Height

Set the height of group header rows using the `headerGroupHeight` property on the grid state.
All column groups share the same group-header height.

!demo:Column Group Header Height="./demos/column-header-group-height_x"

The demo updates the group header height by setting the `headerGroupHeight` state:

```ts
grid.state.headerGroupHeight.set(60);
```

## Floating Row Height

The floating row appears directly under the column header and is useful for supplemental UI,
such as floating filters. Set its height using the `floatingRowHeight` property.

The demo below shows a simple example that adds text-matching filters for string columns. For
more details, see the [Column Floating Header guide](/docs/column-floating-header).

!demo:Floating Row Height="./demos/column-header-floating-row-height_x"

The demo updates the floating row height by setting the `floatingRowHeight` state:

```ts
grid.state.floatingRowHeight.set(60);
```
