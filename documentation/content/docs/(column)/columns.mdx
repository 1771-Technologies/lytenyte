  This guide details how to use columns to configure dynamic views.

## Columns View Specification

A column in LyteNyte Grid defines the specification (or type interface)
the grid follows to configure how cells and headers are displayed. LyteNyte Grid
accepts an array of columns, which developers **provide** to the grid through the
`Grid.useLyteNyte` hook.

For example, defining a set of columns can be done as follows:

```ts
const columns: Column<OrderData>[] = [
  { id: "id", width: 60, widthMin: 60, cellRenderer: IdCell, name: "ID" },
  { id: "product", cellRenderer: ProductCell, width: 200 },
  { id: "price", type: "number", cellRenderer: PriceCell, width: 100 },
  { id: "customer", cellRenderer: AvatarCell, width: 180 },
  { id: "purchaseDate", cellRenderer: PurchaseDateCell, name: "Purchase Date", width: 120 },
  { id: "paymentMethod", cellRenderer: PaymentMethodCell, name: "Payment Method" },
  { id: "email", cellRenderer: EmailCell, width: 220 },
];
```

Notice from the definitions above:

- Each column has an `id` property. This is the only **required** property
  for columns provided to LyteNyte Grid.
- The `width` property determines the horizontal space the
  column's cells occupy in the viewport.
- The `widthMin` sets the minimum allowable width for the column.
- The `name` property provides a display name for components that
  use the column specification.
- The `cellRenderer` property accepts a React component for
  rendering the cell's content.

The example specification contains only a few of the available properties
for a column. The remaining guides in this section cover all configuration
possibilities, but you can refer to the [Column API reference](/docs/reference/column#column)
for details on every configuration option a column accepts.

Think of columns declaratively. As the developer, you provide LyteNyte Grid
with the column specification. LyteNyte Grid follows the specification
to create the correct view. Hence, updating the columns in the grid updates the current view.

**LyteNyte Grid** does not maintain a separate column state from the
column specification. The `columns` property is the **source of truth** for
the grid. This source of truth includes implicit state,
such as column ordering, which the grid infers from the
order of columns in the array.

## Complete Working Example

The example below shows the columns defined earlier in use.
Use this example as a lightweight introduction to what is possible with columns
and how even a relatively small amount of configuration creates rich data experiences.
