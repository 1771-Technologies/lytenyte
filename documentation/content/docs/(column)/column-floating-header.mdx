title: Column Floating Header
description: LyteNyte Grid's floating row is a specialized header row that appears
  below the main column headers. It lets you render custom components for
  each column. While often used for filtering interfaces, you can use it
  for any component type.

# Column Floating Header

Enable the floating header row by setting `floatingRowEnabled` to `true`
in the grid configuration. Once enabled, a row appears below the column
headers with cells for each column. Each floating cell's content comes
from the column's `floatingCellRenderer` property.

## Floating Cell Components

Set a column's `floatingCellRenderer` to a React component or a string.
If you provide a string, it acts as a lookup key for components
registered in the grid's state. Use the grid's
`floatingCellRenderers` property to register these components.

We recommend registering floating cell renderers and referencing them
from columns instead of providing React components directly. This
practice keeps columns serializable and simplifies debugging.

## Toggling the Floating Row Visibility

Toggle the floating row by updating the grid's
`floatingRowEnabled` state:

```ts
const toggleFloatingFilter = () => grid.state.floatingRowEnabled.set((prev) => !prev);
```
