title: Column Field
description: The field property in LyteNyte Grid determines the cell value for a
  given row in a specific column.
---

LyteNyte Grid supports four types of values for `field`:

- **String**: When row data is an object. The string acts as a key to
  look up the value.
- **Number**: When row data is an array. The number acts as the index in
  the array.
- **Function**: A callback for custom calculations of a column's value.
- **Path object**: `{ kind: "path"; path: string }` to access nested
  values. `kind` must be `"path"`, and `path` must specify the lookup.

`field` is optional. If omitted, LyteNyte Grid uses the column's `id` as
a fallback.

## Key Lookup Fields

When `field` is a string, the grid uses it as a key to access the value
in object row data.

!demo:Key Lookup Fields="./demos/column-field-key"

If no `field` is set, the grid uses the column `id`. Because `id` must
be a string, this fallback behaves like a key lookup.

## Number Index Fields

When `field` is a number, row data should be an array. The number acts
as the index for retrieving the value.

!demo:Number Index Fields="./demos/column-field-number-index"

## Function Fields

Set `field` to a function for maximum flexibility. The function can
compute values using other columns.

!demo:Function Fields="./demos/column-field-function"

## Path Fields

Set `field` to `{ kind: "path", path: string }` to access nested object
values.

!demo:Path Fields="./demos/column-field-path-fields"

The `path` syntax matches [Lodash's get](https://lodash.com/docs/#get):

```ts
{ kind: 1, path: "alpha.beta[0]" };
{ kind: 1, path: "beta[0].alpha" };
```

## Which Field Type to Use

Prefer `string` or `number` fields for simplicity. Number fields are
compact and efficient. Function and path fields add complexity and may
prevent serialization of column definitions.
