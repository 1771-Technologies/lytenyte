title: Column Field
description: A column's field determines how LyteNyte Grid retrieves a cell value.
  LyteNyte Grid supports four field types, and this guide explains each one.
---

Set a column's value source using the `field` property on the column definition.
The `field` property applies only to individual columns and cannot be set on the
[base column specification](/docs/column-base).

LyteNyte Grid supports four field types:

- **String:** Use when row data is an object. The string is the key used to read the value.
- **Number:** Use when row data is an array. The number is the index in the array.
- **Function:** A callback that computes the column's value.
- **Path object:** An object of the form `{ kind: "path"; path: string }` for accessing nested values. `kind` must be `"path"` and `path` defines the lookup.

The `field` property is optional. If omitted, LyteNyte Grid uses the column's `id` as
a fallback, which behaves the same as a string field.

## String Fields

When `field` is a string, the grid uses it as a key to read the value from
object-based row data. Use string fields when each row is a standard JavaScript object.
This is demonstrated in the example below:

!demo:String Field="./demos/column-field-string_x"

In the example, each column specifies its `field` directly:

```ts
const columns = [
  { id: "Symbol", field: "symbol" },
  { id: "Network", field: "network" },
  { id: "Exchange", field: "exchange" },
  // other columns
];
```

## Number Fields

When `field` is a number, row data must be an array. The number acts as the index used
to retrieve the value. In the demo below, each row is an array, so each column uses a numeric index.

!demo:Number Index Fields="./demos/column-field-number-index_x"

The column definitions specify numeric indices. These indices do not need to be sequential:

```ts
const columns: Column<StockData>[] = [
  { field: 0, id: "symbol", name: "Symbol" },
  { field: 2, id: "analyst-rating" },
  { field: 3, id: "price", type: "number" },
  { field: 5, id: "change", type: "number" },
  { field: 11, id: "eps", type: "number" },
  { field: 6, id: "volume", type: "number" },
];
```

Number fields are efficient. In JavaScript, array indexing usually performs better
than key-based lookups, and array-structured row data is often more compact than
object-based data. This makes number fields a strong choice for performance-sensitive grids.

## Function Fields

A function field offers the most flexible way to compute a column's value.
You provide a function, and LyteNyte Grid calls it for each row to compute the
cell value. Function fields are commonly mixed with other field types rather
than being used for every column.

LyteNyte Grid passes a single argument to the function. This argument contains
either aggregated group data or leaf-row data, depending on the row being processed.
See the [field data param](docs/reference/field#fielddataparam) for the exact type.

Function fields are ideal for derived or calculated values. In the
demo below, the **Price in GBP** column computes a value from the base **Price** column.

!demo:Function Fields="./demos/column-field-function_x"

## Path Fields

Set the `field` property to an object of the form `{ kind: "path"; path: string }` to retrieve a nested value from the row data.
The `path` syntax matches [Lodash's `get`](https://lodash.com/docs/#get) function. Examples:

```ts
{ kind: "path", path: "alpha.beta[0]" };
{ kind: "path", path: "beta[0].alpha" };
```

The demo below shows path fields in use. Each row exposes temperatures
under a `temps` property keyed by month, so fields such
as `{ kind: "path", path: "temps.Jan" }` read the appropriate value.
