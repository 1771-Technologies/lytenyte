LyteNyte Grid lets you pin columns to the start or end of the viewport.
Pinned columns stay visible as users scroll horizontally. For best
usability, pin only one or two columns at a time.

We use `start` and `end` instead of `right` or `left` to indicate
pinning positions for both RTL and LTR modes.

## Pinning Columns to Start

Set a column's `pin` property to `"start"` to pin it to the start. In
LTR mode, start-pinned columns stay on the left; in RTL mode, they stay
on the right.

## Pinning Columns to End

Set a column's `pin` property to `"end"` to pin it to the end. In LTR
mode, end-pinned columns stay on the right; in RTL mode, they stay on
the left.

import ColumnPinningEnd from "./demos/column-pinning-end/demo";

!demo:Column Pinning End="./demos/column-pinning-end"

## Column Pinning Considerations

When using both start-pinned and end-pinned columns, ensure enough space
remains to display them while still scrolling unpinned columns in the
middle.
