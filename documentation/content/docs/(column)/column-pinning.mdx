title: Column Pinning
description: LyteNyte Grid supports pinning columns to the start or end of the
  grid's viewport. Pinned columns remaining visible even as the user scrolls horizontally.

<Callout>

LyteNyte Grid uses the `start` and `end` terminology for referring to
position, rather than `left` or `right`. This aligns with the logical CSS
properties, such as `paddingInlineStart` instead of `paddingLeft`. This
ensures pinned column functionality works seamlessly for both LTR and RTL modes.

## Pinning Columns to Start

Set a column's `pin` property to `"start"` to pin it to the start. In
LTR mode, start-pinned columns stay on the left; in RTL mode, they stay
on the right.

!demo:Column Pinning Start="./demos/column-pinning-start_x"

In the demo the **ID** and **Product** columns are pinned to the beginning of the
grid's viewport. The column definitions for this are shown below:

```ts
const columns: Column<OrderData>[] = [
  { id: "id", pin: "start" },
  { id: "product", pin: "start" },
  // other definitions
];
```

## Pinning Columns to End

Set a column's `pin` property to `"end"` to pin it to the end. In LTR
mode, end-pinned columns stay on the right; in RTL mode, they stay on
the left.

!demo:Column Pinning End="./demos/column-pinning-end_x"

In the demo the **ID** and **Product** columns are pinned to the end of the
grid's viewport. The column definitions for this are shown below:

```ts
const columns: Column<OrderData>[] = [
  { id: "id", pin: "end" },
  { id: "product", pin: "end" },
  // other definitions
];
```

## Pinning Columns Start & End

LyteNyte Grid supports pinning columns both start and end at the same time. The demo
below demonstrates this. Pinning on both sides as simple as specifying that some columns
should be pinned to the start of the grid and others to the end.

!demo:Column Pinning Start & End="./demos/column-pinning-both_x"

## Column Pinning Considerations

When using both start-pinned and end-pinned columns, ensure enough space
remains to display them while still scrolling unpinned columns in the
middle. LyteNyte Grid does not prevent the pinned sections from overlapping,
and if they do overlap the columns pinned `end` will be visible above those
pinned right.

- [Column Base](/docs/column-base): See the default column values and how to override them.
- [Column Resizing](/docs/column-resizing): Change column widths programmatically or through user interaction.
- [Column ID & Name](/docs/column-header-name): Define user-friendly column names and ensure unique IDs.
- [Column Field](/docs/column-field): Control how a column retrieves each cells value.
