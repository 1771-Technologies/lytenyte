title: Column Pinning
description: LyteNyte Grid supports pinning columns to the start or end
  of the viewport. Pinned columns stay visible as the user scrolls horizontally.

<Callout>

LyteNyte Grid uses the `start` and `end` terminology for column position instead
of `left` or `right`. This matches logical CSS properties
like `paddingInlineStart`, ensuring pinned column behavior works consistently
in both LTR and RTL modes.

</Callout>

## Pinning Columns to Start

Set a column's `pin` property to `"start"` to pin it to the beginning of the grid's viewport.
In LTR mode, start-pinned columns appear on the left; in RTL mode, they appear on the right.

!demo:Column Pinning Start="./demos/column-pinning-start_x"

In the demo, the **ID** and **Product** columns are
pinned to the start of the viewport:

```ts
const columns: Column<OrderData>[] = [
  { id: "id", pin: "start" },
  { id: "product", pin: "start" },
  // other definitions
];
```

## Pinning Columns to End

Set a column's `pin` property to `"end"` to pin it to the end of the grid's viewport.
In LTR mode, end-pinned columns appear on the right; in RTL
mode, they appear on the left.

!demo:Column Pinning End="./demos/column-pinning-end_x"

In the demo, the **ID** and **Product** columns are pinned to the end of the viewport:

```ts
const columns: Column<OrderData>[] = [
  { id: "id", pin: "end" },
  { id: "product", pin: "end" },
  // other definitions
];
```

## Pinning Columns Start & End

LyteNyte Grid supports pinning columns to both the start and end.
The demo below shows this behavior. Pin columns on both sides by
assigning some columns `pin: "start"` and others `pin: "end"`.

!demo:Column Pinning Start & End="./demos/column-pinning-both_x"

In the demo, the **ID** and **Product** columns are pinned to the start and end of the viewport respectively:

```ts
const columns: Column<OrderData>[] = [
  { id: "id", pin: "end" },
  { id: "product", pin: "start" },
  // other definitions
];
```

## Column Pinning Considerations

When using both start-pinned and end-pinned columns, ensure enough space
remains for unpinned columns to scroll between them. LyteNyte Grid does
not prevent pinned regions from overlapping. If they overlap, columns
pinned to `"end"` appear above those pinned to `"start"`.

- [Column ID & Name](/docs/column-header-name): Define user-friendly column names and ensure unique IDs.
- [Column Floating Header](/docs/column-floating-header): Add a secondary header row for extra header features.
- [Column Visibility](/docs/column-visibility): Control which columns are visible.
