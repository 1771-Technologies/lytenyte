title: Column Groups
description: LyteNyte Grid lets you organize columns into groups to create visual
  relationships between related columns. Each column belongs to only one
  group. Groups can contain nested groups to form hierarchies.
---

## Creating a Column Group

Create column groups in LyteNyte Grid by setting the `groupPath`
property on columns. The grid builds a hierarchy based on all
`groupPath` values in your columns.

!demo:Column Groups="./demos/column-groups"

The longest path in your hierarchy determines the number of group rows.
If a column is not part of any group, or belongs to a group with a
shorter path, its header spans the empty group rows.

### Split Column Groups

LyteNyte Grid identifies column groups by the `groupPath` property.
Groups appear split if columns from other groups appear between group
members. This creates multiple visual instances of the same logical
group. When you move separated group columns next to each other, the
grid merges them automatically. Pinned columns always appear visually
separate from non-pinned columns, even within the same group.

!demo:Column Groups Split="./demos/column-groups-split"

Visually split groups still function as a single logical group in grid
state. Expanding or collapsing one affects all visual instances.

## Column Group Expansions

You can expand or collapse column groups. The `groupVisibility`
property controls column visibility:

- `"open"`: Show the column only when the group is expanded.
- `"closed"`: Show the column only when the group is collapsed.
- `"always"`: Show the column regardless of the group's state.

If all columns in a group use `"always"`, you cannot collapse the group.
To make a group collapsible, include at least one column hidden when
expanded and one visible when expanded.

!demo:Column Group Expansion="./demos/column-groups-expansions"

### Initial Group State

Configure the initial expansion state of column groups by understanding
how LyteNyte Grid generates group `id`s.

The `groupPath` array defines the hierarchy. The grid joins the array
using a delimiter (set via `columnGroupJoinDelimiter`) to form the group
`id`.

The `columnGroupExpansions` property controls the initial expansion
state. Keys are group `id`s and values are booleans. Groups without an
explicit value use `columnGroupDefaultExpansion` (defaults to `true`).

!demo:Column Group Initial State="./demos/column-groups-initial-state"

Because `columnGroupExpansions`, `columnGroupDefaultExpansion`, and
`columnGroupJoinDelimiter` are part of grid state, you can update them
at runtime:

```ts
// Reset all groups to their default expansion state
grid.state.columnGroupExpansions.set({});
```

Avoid changing `columnGroupJoinDelimiter` after setup, since the grid
won't update existing group ids automatically.

## Programmatically Toggle Groups

Call the `columnToggleGroup` API method to toggle a group's expansion
state programmatically.
