  layouts

Use the `colSpan` property to make cells span multiple columns in
LyteNyte Grid. For example, setting `colSpan` to `2` makes a cell extend
across two columns. The grid skips rendering cells covered by the span.

The `colSpan` property can be a `number` or a function that returns the
number of columns a cell should span.

## Column Span Scan Distance

For performance, LyteNyte Grid does not calculate all spans in advance.
Instead, it scans back from the first visible column, based on the
scroll position. Control this lookback with the `colScanDistance`
property.

`colScanDistance` must be at least the maximum possible span in your
grid. Make sure no span exceeds this value to ensure proper rendering.

LyteNyte Grid uses a scan distance for correctness and performance.
Other grids may pre-calculate spans (hurting scalability) or render
incorrectly based on scroll position. This approach requires you to
specify a max span, but it preserves both performance and accuracy.

In most real-world cases, a scan distance of `100` is more than enough,
since it's rare for a column to span more than 100 columns.
