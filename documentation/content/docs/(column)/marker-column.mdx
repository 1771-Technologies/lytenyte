description: Understanding the automatically generated marker column and its
  functionality in LyteNyte Grid
---

The marker column is a special column you can enable in the grid state.
LyteNyte Grid creates and manages it automatically. It is not part of
your column definitions and is always frozen to the start of the grid.

The marker column provides auxiliary row functionality, such as a
selection checkbox or an expand icon for master-detail features.

## Marker Column Usage

Enable the marker column by setting `markerColumnEnabled` to `true` on
the grid. You can define it with the `markerColumn` property. The
example below shows a marker column with checkbox selection.
