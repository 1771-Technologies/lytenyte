title: Column Visibility
description:
  LyteNyte Grid supports defining columns where only some are initially visible. Developers can toggle
  column visibility at runtime. The grid also supports column groups,
  which allow related columns to be shown or hidden together.

## Hiding Columns

Each column in LyteNyte Grid has a `hide` property in its specification. This property defaults to `false`.
When set to `true`, the grid does not render the column in the viewport.
The grid still includes the column internally, and queries against
grid state will continue to return it.

In the demo below, the **Network** and **Exchange** columns start hidden.
Clicking their pills toggles each column's visibility.
When a hidden column becomes visible, the grid inserts it based on
its position in the column state.

The Pill Manager calls the grid API's `columnUpdate` method when a pill is clicked.
The snippet below shows how the handler toggles the `hide` property. LyteNyte Grid handles
updating the visual display of the viewport.

```ts
grid.api.columnUpdate({
  [c.data.id]: { hide: !c.data.hide },
});
```

<Callout>

Avoid updating a column's visibility too frequently. Each update triggers a layout recalculation and
DOM update, which can be expensive when performed many times per second.

## Column Group Visibility

A column group is a developer-defined collection of related columns.
A group may be collapsed, causing certain columns to appear only when the group is open.

When the grid collapses a group, it hides the affected columns visually.
However, this behavior differs from setting `hide` on a column specification.
The grid still considers these columns logically visible.
In other words, their visibility state remains `true` even though the
collapsed group hides them in the UI.

The example below demonstrates this behavior. The **Market Info** group is collapsed,
which hides the **Network** and **Exchange** columns. The Pill Manager still shows
them as visible because the grid treats them as visible in state,
even though the collapsed group hides them visually.
