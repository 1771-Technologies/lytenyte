  Grid, including interaction with column groups.

Control column visibility in LyteNyte Grid with the column's `hide`
property. A column may also be visually omitted when it belongs to a
group that is collapsed (or expanded, for columns meant to show only
when the group is closed). This guide explains how to configure column
visibility and the nuances of showing and hiding columns.

## Hiding Columns

Set a column's `hide` property to `true` to hide it. Users typically
toggle visibility with LyteNyte Grid components like the
[Column Manager](/docs/component-column-manager).

### Hiding Columns and Column Groups

When a column belongs to a group, its visibility can change based on
the group's state.

LyteNyte Grid does not treat these temporarily hidden columns as fully
hidden. It considers them part of a temporary view state caused by user
interaction, not a permanent visibility setting. While most use cases
are unaffected, keep this in mind when managing column visibility in
code.

The example below shows this difference. The `job` column is hidden when the
group is collapsed but is still considered a visible column since it's `hide`
property is not `true`.
