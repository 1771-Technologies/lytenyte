title: Column Visibility
description: LyteNyte Grid may be given a set of columns where only some of the columns are
  initially visible to the user. The visibility of columns may be updated to toggle which ones
  are visible. LyteNyte Grid, additionally supports column groups which allow related columns
  to be hidden or shown.

## Hiding Columns

Every column in LyteNyte Grid has a `hide` property on the column specification. By default this
property is `false`, but if set to `true`, the column will not be rendered in the viewport. This
does not remove the column from LyteNyte Grid, and querying the columns in grid state will return
it.

In the demo below, the **Network** and **Exchange** columns are hidden. Clicking the respective pills
will toggle the column's visibility. When a column that is hidden becomes visible it will be displayed
in the order it appears in the columns state of the grid.

!demo:Hiding Columns="./demos/column-visibility_x"

If you examine the code for the Pill Manager, you will notice that clicking a pill is simply calling the
`columnUpdate` method on the grid API. The code below shows the snippet. The visibility setting is simply
toggled. LyteNyte Grid handles the rest.

```ts
grid.api.columnUpdate({
  [c.data.id]: { hide: !c.data.hide },
});
```

<Callout>

Exercise caution when frequently updating the visibility of a column as this can become a
performance bottleneck if the updates occur too frequently. Updating a column results in
LyteNyte Grid recomputing its layout calculation as well as updating the actual DOM layout.
These operations can be quite expensive if performed many times per second.

## Column Group Visibility

LyteNyte Grid columns may be part of a column group. A column group is a collection of columns
that are related in some fashion define by the developer. A column group may be collapsed when
some columns are configured to be visible when the group is open and hidden when the group
is closed.

When a column group is collapsed some columns will be hidden. However, this is not the same as
setting the columns `hide` property on its specification. A column that is hidden because its
group is collapsed is treated as visually hidden but logically visible. In simpler terms, the
column's state is still visible even if it is hidden because its group is collapsed.

The example below demonstrates this. Notice that the **Market Info** group is collapsed, hiding
the **Network** and **Exchange** columns, however the pill manager still displays them as visible.
This is because these columns are still visible in grid state, just hidden visually due to the group
being collapsed.
