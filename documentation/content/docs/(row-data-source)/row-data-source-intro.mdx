description: Learn how LyteNyte Grid uses row data sources to load, manage, and
  render rows efficiently.
---

A row data source supplies LyteNyte Grid with the rows it must render.
It manages both the raw data and the operations that determine how
rows appear in the viewport.

A row data source handles these key tasks:

- Reporting total row counts, including pinned top and bottom rows
- Retrieving rows by index or by ID
- Running data aggregations
- Creating dynamic pivots
- Updating row data in place
- Managing in-filter items
- Handling pagination

Not all row data sources support every feature in the interface. For
example, the [Tree Row Data Source](/docs/row-tree-data-source) does not
support column pivots.

## Available Row Data Sources

LyteNyte Grid includes several built-in row data sources for common
scenarios. You can also create your own for specialized needs.

- [Client Row Data Source](/docs/row-client-data-source): Load all data
  in the browser. Ideal for smaller datasets-up to tens of thousands of
  rows for maximum feature support.

- [Server Row Data Source](/docs/row-server-data-source) (PRO only):
  Load data in blocks from a server. The grid fetches only what it needs
  to render, making this the best choice for massive datasets-from
  millions to billions of rows.

- [Tree Data Source](/docs/row-tree-data-source) (PRO only): Render
  hierarchical structures in a tree view. This is a client-side data
  source designed for tree-like datasets.
