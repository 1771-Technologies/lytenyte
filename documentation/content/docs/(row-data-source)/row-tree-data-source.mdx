description: Learn how to effectively use the hierarchical Tree Row Data Source in LyteNyte Grid
  to display and manage parent-child relationships while maintaining full grid functionality.

The LyteNyte Grid tree data source enables you to represent hierarchical data while preserving all grid
functionality, including sorting and filtering. Tree Data is particularly valuable for visualizing
data with natural parent-child relationships, such as file directory structures.

## Basic Usage

Begin by importing the tree data source hook from the LyteNyte Grid package:

```ts
import { useClientTreeDataSource } from "@1771technologies/lytenyte-pro";
```

You can then use the data source returned by `useClientTreeDataSource` when initializing your
grid state. Below is a minimal example:

!demo:Tree Data Source="./demos/row-tree-data-source"

### The Tree Path

The `useClientTreeDataSource` hook requires several essential parameters:

- `getPathFromData`: A callback that returns the tree path for a given data item. Return an empty array for a root row.
- `data`: The leaf tree data. LyteNyte uses this data and the `getPathFromData` callback to construct the tree.

The most critical parameter is the `getPathFromData` callback, which determines how the tree
structure is generated from your raw data. This essentially functions as the grouping mechanism for the data source.

## Pinned Rows

Like the [client row data source](/docs/row-client-data-source), the tree data source
accepts `topData` and `bottomData` parameters to create rows pinned to the top
and bottom respectively. Pinned rows must be leaf rows and exist outside
the normal tree grouping structure.
