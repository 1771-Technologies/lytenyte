title: Client Row Data Source
description: Learn how to implement and use the client-side row data source in
  LyteNyte Grid for fast, in-browser datasets.
---

Use LyteNyte Grid's client data source when you can load the entire
dataset into the browser. This source stores all rows in memory and
assumes the complete dataset is available on the client. It is the
simplest of all data sources, but also the most feature rich.

Do not underestimate the scalability of the client data source.
JavaScript runs faster than many expect, and LyteNyte Grid optimizes
client-side operations heavily. The client data source can handle well
over 50,000 rows efficiently. The real bottleneck is usually the network
transfer time, which may or may not be an issue for your users.

## Create a Client Data Source

Import and call the `useClientRowDataSource` hook to create a client
data source. Pass it the initial row data. The hook returns an object
that implements the row data source interface. For details, see the
[API Reference](/docs/reference).

### Top and Bottom Data

You can include pinned rows at the top and bottom of the grid. These
rows remain visible while users scroll through the main dataset.

### Access All Data

The LyteNyte Grid API does not offer a single method to retrieve every
row from the grid because each data source loads differently. The
client-side row data source includes a `rowData` method that returns all
rows currently loaded in memory.

```ts
const ds = useClientRowDataSource({
  data: companiesWithPricePerf,
});

// Get all row data in a flat array
const rowData = ds.rowData("flat");
```
