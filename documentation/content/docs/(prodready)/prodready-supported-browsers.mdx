## Usage of Baseline Features

LyteNyte Grid may use any feature classified as **_baseline_**.
Baseline features are available across all modern browsers. If
you are unfamiliar with how baseline status is determined, see this
[Baseline article on web.dev](https://web.dev/baseline) for an overview.

Since LyteNyte Grid limits itself to baseline features, it does not rely on any
browser-specific APIs. However, some internal logic reads the user agent to
identify the current browser and adjust behavior to better handle browser inconsistencies.
These adjustments happen entirely within the grid and require no action from developers.

Users with nonstandard environments that override the user agent
should be aware that this may impact these internal checks.
