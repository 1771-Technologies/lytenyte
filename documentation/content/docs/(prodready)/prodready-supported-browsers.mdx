## Usage of Baseline Features

LyteNyte Grid may use any feature classified as _baseline_.
Baseline features are available across all modern browsers. If
you are unfamiliar with how baseline status is determined, see this
[web.dev article](https://web.dev/baseline) for an overview.

Because LyteNyte Grid limits itself to baseline features, it does not
rely on any browser-specific APIs. However, some internal logic reads
the user agent to detect the current browser and adjust behavior to smooth over
browser inconsistencies. These adjustments run entirely inside the grid and require
no action from developers. Users with nonstandard environments that
override the user agent should be aware that doing so may affect these internal checks.
