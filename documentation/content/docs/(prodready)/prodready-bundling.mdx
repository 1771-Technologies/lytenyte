title: Bundling and Tree Shaking
description:
  LyteNyte Grid is engineered for optimal bundling and tree shaking, ensuring your final bundle
  includes only the components you actually use. This guide explains how to leverage these features to
  create smaller, more efficient applications.

## Tree Shaking

Tree shaking is a technique that eliminates unused JavaScript code from your final bundle. LyteNyte
Grid fully supports tree shaking across all its exported names.

LyteNyte Grid is available in two editions:

- **Core**: Free functionality with essential features (Apache 2.0 License)
- **PRO**: Enhanced version with comprehensive enterprise-grade features

Both editions fully support tree shaking and are built as modern ESM packages adhering to current
JavaScript standards.

## Choosing a Bundler

LyteNyte Grid works seamlessly with any standards-compliant bundler. Modern web development offers
several excellent options, including:

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/)
- [Rspack](https://rspack.dev/)

### Best Practices

Follow these guidelines to ensure optimal bundling when using LyteNyte Grid:

1. **Use ES Modules**: Prefer ES module syntax (`import` and `export` statements) over CommonJS
   modules (`require` statements)

2. **Enable Tree Shaking**: Verify that tree shaking is enabled in your bundler configuration

3. **Avoid Side Effects**: Ensure your code doesn't introduce side effects that could prevent
   tree shaking, such as modifying imported modules or using imported functions in ways that can't
   be statically analyzed

4. **Use Specific Imports**: Avoid `import * as All from "<package-name>"` syntax
   as these wildcard imports can prevent most bundlers from effectively tree shaking

By following these guidelines and leveraging LyteNyte Grid's optimized architecture, you can create
efficient applications with minimal bundle size while maintaining full functionality.

If you're using a modern front-end framework like Next.js, Remix, or Vite, you don't need to
worry about manually applying these best practices. These frameworks implement
these optimizations by default, allowing you to simply add LyteNyte Grid as
a dependency and immediately begin using the grid.
