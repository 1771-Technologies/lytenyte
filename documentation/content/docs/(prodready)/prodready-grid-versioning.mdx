title: Grid Versioning
description: Understand LyteNyte Grid's versioning system, release strategy, and how to ensure
  you're using the appropriate version for your enterprise license.
---

All LyteNyte Grid packages follow [semver](https://semver.org/) versioning. A LyteNyte Grid version
consists of three numbers separated by periods, such as `1.2.0`.

Each number in a version corresponds to a specific type of release (major.minor.patch):

- **Major**: Indicates incompatible changes that break backward compatibility. Adopting a new major
  version may require code changes in your application.

- **Minor**: Represents compatible changes and new features that maintain backward compatibility.
  These versions work with your existing code without requiring modifications.

- **Patch**: Denotes releases containing bug fixes and minor improvements.

We commonly refer to minor and patch releases as **updates**, while **major** releases are
considered **upgrades**.

## Release Cadence

LyteNyte Grid does not follow a fixed release schedule. Bug fixes are released as soon as they
pass all internal checks and testing procedures.

While major releases with new capabilities may seem desirable, we recognize that developers prefer
stability and minimal code changes. With this in mind, 1771 Technologies strives to minimize or
completely eliminate breaking changes. Most feature improvements are delivered as compatible minor
updates.

When adding significant features to LyteNyte Grid, we may advance to a new major version even without
breaking changes - primarily to highlight substantial new functionality. Breaking changes
will always be clearly documented in our [changelog](/docs/changelog/latest). While not every
major release contains breaking changes, any breaking change will trigger a major version
increment. This ensures your code remains stable when updating minor versions only.

## Checking for the Latest Version

You can verify the latest published version on the
[NPM Registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@1771technologies/lytenyte-pro).

### Version Date

For license holders, your license covers all versions released within your license term
(typically one year from purchase date). If you use a version of LyteNyte Grid outside your license
term, a watermark will appear in your application.

LyteNyte Grid exports both the version number and version date for reference:

```ts
import { versionDate, version } from "@1771technologies/lytenyte-pro";
```
