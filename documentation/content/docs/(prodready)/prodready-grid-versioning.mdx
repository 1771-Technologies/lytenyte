title: Grid Versioning
description:
  LyteNyte Grid follows a semver versioning approach. The major version increments on breaking
  changes, the minor version increments when new non-breaking features are added, and the patch
  version increments on bug fixes and code improvements.
---

## LyteNyte and Semver

All LyteNyte Grid packages follow [semver](https://semver.org/) versioning.
Each version consists of three numbers (major.minor.patch), such as `1.2.0`.

Each number represents a different type of release:

- **Major**: Introduces breaking changes that require updates in your application.
- **Minor**: Adds new, backward-compatible features and works with your existing code.
- **Patch**: Includes bug fixes and small improvements.

We refer to minor and patch releases as **updates**, while **major** releases are treated as **upgrades**.

## Release Cadence

LyteNyte Grid does not follow a fixed release schedule.
Bug fixes ship as soon as they pass internal testing.

Although major releases may introduce significant new capabilities, we prioritize
stability and aim to avoid breaking changes. Most enhancements are
delivered as backward-compatible minor updates.

When a release adds substantial new functionality, we may publish a new major
version even without breaking changes. Breaking changes are always documented in
the [changelog](/docs/changelog/latest). While not every major release contains
breaking changes, any breaking change will trigger a major version bump. This
ensures your application remains stable when updating only minor versions.

### Checking for the Latest Version

You can find the latest published version on the
[NPM Registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@1771technologies/lytenyte-pro).

### Fixed Versioning

LyteNyte Grid packages use a fixed versioning scheme. The code base is a monorepo,
and all packages are released under the same version number. As a result, the
LyteNyte Grid Core and LyteNyte Grid PRO packages always share the same version,
even when a change affects only one package.

## LyteNyte PRO Version and PRO License

When you purchase a LyteNyte Grid PRO license, you receive one year of updates.
You may use any version released within your license period. Versions released after your
license expires require purchasing a new license.

New releases do not affect your ability to use older versions.
Any version published during your active license term may be used indefinitely.

For a detailed explanation of licensing terms, see our [Pricing page](https://www.1771technologies.com/pricing).
