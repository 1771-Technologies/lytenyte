  LyteNyte Grid within your web applications.

This guide outlines key security considerations when
implementing LyteNyte Grid in your projects. These guidelines
apply to both the free `Core` edition and the `PRO` edition.

## Content Security Policy

LyteNyte Grid may require specific Content Security Policy (CSP) configurations for optimal
operation. If you need background information on CSP, refer to the
[MDN article on Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP).

### Setting `style-src`

To utilize LyteNyte Grid's full capabilities, your CSP's `style-src` directive must include
`unsafe-inline`. This requirement supports the grid's advanced layout and virtualization features.
Add the following to your HTML to implement this requirement:

<Callout>

You only need to add this meta tag if you are using a bespoke meta framework. All the
popular frameworks such as Vite, React Router, TanStack Start, Next JS, etc, already
have the necessary meta tags provided.

</Callout>

```html
<meta
  http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"
  content="default-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';"
/>
```

While the `unsafe-inline` directive is necessary, LyteNyte Grid's implementation of inline styles is
carefully engineered to mitigate security vulnerabilities commonly associated with dynamic UI
components. Using `unsafe-inline` could potentially expose a site to cross-site scripting (XSS)
attacks by allowing malicious inline scripts and styles. However, LyteNyte Grid addresses these
concerns through:

- **Sanitization**: LyteNyte Grid thoroughly sanitizes and validates all style definitions before
  application, ensuring they are free from harmful code or malicious content.

- **Controlled Execution Context**: LyteNyte Grid restricts the dynamic generation of inline styles
  to a controlled execution context, significantly reducing the potential for malicious code
  execution.

- **Content Isolation**: The grid operates in a manner that isolates dynamically generated content
  from sensitive DOM elements and prevents script execution, providing protection against XSS attacks.

- **Framework Compatibility**: Modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries commonly used with
  LyteNyte Grid, incorporate built-in mechanisms to safely handle inline styles and
  mitigate related risks. These frameworks provide additional security layers that complement
  LyteNyte Grid's protective measures.

Through these combined approaches, LyteNyte Grid ensures that the use of `unsafe-inline` styles does
not compromise your web application's security. This architecture allows you to leverage LyteNyte
Grid's powerful features while maintaining a strong security posture.

It's worth noting that many modern web frameworks and development environments typically configure
`unsafe-inline` in their default CSP due to similar requirements and established security practices.

## Secure Data Transportation

LyteNyte Grid is a client-side grid library that functions entirely within the browser without
server communication. All data processed by LyteNyte Grid is supplied by the host web application,
which bears responsibility for securing this data before transferring it to the grid.
