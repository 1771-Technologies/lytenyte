description: LyteNyte Grid ships unstyled by default, so you can apply any CSS
  approach you prefer. This guide offers tips on the best styling
  practices and shows different ways to style LyteNyte Grid components.

## Applying Styles

LyteNyte Grid is headless. Most components expose props for styling,
but some such as cell selection overlay rectangles -are not directly
accessible. These must be styled with CSS selectors.

For exposed components, simply add your CSS classes or inline styles.
For example, with
[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), styling a cell is as easy as:

```tsx
<Grid.Cell className="flex items-center text-sm" />
```

This familiar approach means you can style the grid with your existing
design system, without reinventing a new approach to styling a grid.

### Styling Considerations

While unstyled, LyteNyte Grid applies essential inline styles for
`position`, `width`, `height`, and `box-sizing`. Avoid overriding these
as they are necessary for correct grid behavior.

Pinned (frozen) elements are transparent. Always give each cell and
header cell its own background color. Styling only the row is not
enough because pinned elements share the same row.

An easy method is to target the grid's data attributes:

```css
[data-ln-header-cell="true"],
[data-ln-header-group="true"],
[data-ln-cell="true"],
[data-ln-row="true"][data-ln-rowtype="full-width"] {
  background-color: black;
  color: white;
}
```

You can style each selector individually. For reference, check the
LyteNyte themes in our
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/1771-Technologies/lytenyte/blob/main/packages/lytenyte-core/main.css).

## Provided Themes

LyteNyte Grid includes four ready-to-use themes. Apply them by adding
the theme's class name to a parent element (typically `html` or `body`)
along with the `lng-grid` class.

- `lng1771-teal`: teal accent theme.
- `lng1771-term256`: terminal color theme.
- `dark`: standard dark theme.
- `light`: standard light theme.
