title: Grid Reactivity
description: LyteNyte Grid follows declarative principles. Its state system stays
  fully reactive, automatically keeping the view synchronized with state
  changes. This aligns with React's core philosophy that "view is a
  function of state."
---

You can naturally leverage this reactivity in your React code, allowing
smooth integration with other components. LyteNyte Grid achieves this
by using standard React primitives, enabling seamless interaction
throughout your application.

## The Grid State Object

The grid state object serves as your interface to LyteNyte Grid. The
`Grid.useLyteNyte` hook returns it, and it contains a `state` property.
Most keys in this object match those in the initial state you pass to
`useLyteNyte`. This is intentional. LyteNyte Grid also adds several
helpful fields.

While the keys match, the values differ. State values are grid atoms
(observable values) designed for LyteNyte Grid's needs.

Each atom provides `watch`, `get`, `set`, and `useValue` methods. To
integrate an atom with React, call its `useValue` method. This hook
retrieves the current value and triggers re-renders when the value
changes. The `set` method updates the atom's value. Not all fields are
settable, but most props you provide can also be changed reactively
later.

Here's an example:

!demo:Grid Atoms="./demos/grid-reactivity-signal"

The power of `useValue` extends beyond simple reactivity. Because the
grid state comes from `useLyteNyte`, you can lift it to higher
components and share it throughout your app.

For example, you can display a line chart based on the selected row by
passing the grid state to a chart component. Inside the chart, call
`grid.state.rowSelectedIds.useValue` to re-render whenever the selection
set changes:

!demo:Draw Line On Row Selection="./demos/grid-reactivity-chart"

This approach maintains React's one-way data flow without complex
synchronization.

## The Other Atom Methods

Atoms also offer methods for specific scenarios.

### The `get` Method

`get` returns the atom's current value without hook rules, so you can
call it anywhere.

### The `set` Method

`set` updates the atom's value. Like `useState`, it accepts a value or a
function:

```ts
const grid = Grid.useLyteNyte({ gridId: "x" });

grid.state.rowHeight.set(22);
grid.state.rowHeight.set((prev) => prev + 10);
```

Avoid reading immediately after `set`, capture the value first:

```ts
const current = grid.state.rowHeight.get();
grid.state.rowHeight.set(24);
```

### The `watch` Method

`watch` monitors changes. Use it in `useEffect` or handlers, not during
render. It notifies you of changes but doesn't pass the new value
directly:

```ts
const rowHeightAtom = grid.state.rowHeight;

useEffect(() => {
  const remove = rowHeightAtom.watch(() => {
    console.log(rowHeightAtom.peek());
  });

  return remove;
}, [rowHeightAtom]);
```

LyteNyte Grid batches multiple changes into a single `watch` call:

```ts
rowHeightAtom.set(24);
rowHeightAtom.set(32);
rowHeightAtom.set(18);
```

This triggers only one `watch` call. Callbacks run in the microtask
queue.
