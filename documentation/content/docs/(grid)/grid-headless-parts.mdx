title: Headless Component Parts
description: LyteNyte Grid is a headless data grid. Each part of the grid is split out into
  constituent components that may be put together to form the grid view in a declarative way.
---

All the grid components exist under the named `Grid` export from the LyteNyte Grid packages:

<Tabs items={['Core', 'PRO']} className="bg-fd-card">

<Tab value="Core" className="rounded-t-[0px] p-0 [&>div]:rounded-t-[0px]">

```ts
import { Grid } from "@1771technologies/lytenyte-core";
```

</Tab>

<Tab value="PRO" className="rounded-t-[0px] p-0 [&>div]:rounded-t-[0px]">

```ts
import { Grid } from "@1771technologies/lytenyte-pro";
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

Only the components necessary to form the grid view are found under the `Grid` export. Other LyteNyte Grid
parts, such as the row data sources, are separate name exports to allow for tree shaking. The `Grid` components
are coupled and hence must be used together under a common `Grid.Root` component.

The remainder of this guide will take you through the individual grid components,
finally leading up to a complete demo example. Hence, this guide is best read top
to bottom. For a complete full working example,
see our [Getting Started guide](/docs/intro-getting-started).

## Root

The `Grid.Root` component is the main parent of the LyteNyte Grid components. All the other grid parts should be rendered
inside of a `Grid.Root` component. Hence our starting point is. The `Grid.Root` component
accepts a [grid state object](/docs/reference/grid-state/#grid) as a prop. The grid state object is created using the
`Grid.useLyteNyte` hook. The `Grid.Root` component does not result in any DOM elements being created.

<Tabs items={['Core', 'PRO']} className="bg-fd-card">

<Tab value="Core" className="rounded-t-[0px] p-0 [&>div]:rounded-t-[0px]">

```tsx
import { Grid } from "@1771technologies/lytenyte-core";

export function MyGrid() {
  const grid = Grid.useLyteNyte({});

  return <Grid.Root grid={grid} />;
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab value="PRO" className="rounded-t-[0px] p-0 [&>div]:rounded-t-[0px]">

```tsx
import { Grid } from "@1771technologies/lytenyte-pro";

export function MyGrid() {
  const grid = Grid.useLyteNyte({});

  return <Grid.Root grid={grid} />;
}
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

## Viewport

The `Grid.Viewport` component creates an element that will be the overflow parent for the grid.
As it's name suggests it is the visible area of the grid that will display rows and columns based
on the scroll position. The viewport will automatically size to fit its container. See the
[Responsive Container guide](/docs/grid-container) for full guidance on creating grid containers
to house the grid.

Add the `Grid.Viewport` to our grid component, we now have:

<Tabs items={['Core', 'PRO']} className="bg-fd-card">

<Tab value="Core" className="rounded-t-[0px] p-0 [&>div]:rounded-t-[0px]">

```tsx
import { Grid } from "@1771technologies/lytenyte-core";

export function MyGrid() {
  const grid = Grid.useLyteNyte({});

  return (
    <Grid.Root grid={grid}>
      <Grid.Viewport />
    </Grid.Root>
  );
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab value="PRO" className="rounded-t-[0px] p-0 [&>div]:rounded-t-[0px]">

```tsx
import { Grid } from "@1771technologies/lytenyte-pro";

export function MyGrid() {
  const grid = Grid.useLyteNyte({});

  return (
    <Grid.Root grid={grid}>
      <Grid.Viewport />
    </Grid.Root>
  );
}
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

The `Grid.Viewport` component is a `div` element. Hence it accepts all the props a normal `div`
would including `className` and `style`. The `Grid.Viewport` will have some inline-styles applied
for grid sizing, which cannot be overridden.
