title: Grid Events
description: LyteNyte Grid fires events in response to specific user interactions or
  when imperative API methods run. For example, when a cell enters edit
  mode, the grid fires the editBegin event.

This guide explains how to respond to events from LyteNyte Grid and
shows methods to trigger events imperatively when needed.

For a complete list of available events and their triggers, see the
[Events API Reference Page](/docs/reference/events).

## Listening to Events

The `Grid.Root` component accepts event listeners for all events LyteNyte
Grid may fire. Add listeners as you would any other props in React. This
familiar approach is the recommended way to add event listeners.

Furthermore, like native events, some events have a `preventDefault` property
that will stop the default action of that event from happening. For example,
we can prevent odd rows from being selected by listening to the `rowSelectBegin`
event and calling `preventDefault` when it fires.

### The `api.eventAddListener` Method

Sometimes you may need to add an event listener to LyteNyte Grid outside
a render function. Use the `api.eventAddListener` method in such cases.
This method adds a listener for the specified event and returns a
function to remove it. You can also call `api.eventRemoveListener` to
remove a listener explicitly.

When using `api.eventAddListener`, you must handle cleanup yourself. The
example below demonstrates correct usage with proper cleanup.

## Triggering Events

The LyteNyte Grid API provides the `eventFire` method, which lets you
manually trigger an event as if it originated from the grid. This is
useful when building custom functionality that mimics grid event
behavior, but you should avoid it unless necessary.
