## Handling Events

LyteNyte Grid has its own set of events that fire on specific user interactions. This guide
will describe how to listen and respond to these events but it will not cover every single
event the grid may fire. Refer to the [Events API reference](/docs/reference/events) for
specifics on individual events.

### Listening to Events

The simplest way to listen to event is to add an event listen to the `Grid.Root` component.
For example, the demo below will alert the user every time a row is selected.

!demo:Row Selection Event="./demos/grid-add-event-listener"

The code for handling the event is also quite straight forward and this approach should feel
very familiar to React developers:

```tsx
<Grid.Root
  grid={grid}
  onRowSelectEnd={(p) => {
    alert(`The row with ID ${p.selected} was ${p.deselect ? "deselected" : "selected"}`);
  }}
></Grid.Root>
```

### Cancelling LyteNyte Events

In the code above, notice that the row selection event is named `onRowSelectEnd`. This is because many of
LyteNyte Grid's events are split into two or more parts (as some actions may be asynchronous). Using
row selection as an example, there is an `onRowSelectBegin` event that is fired when the user
tries to a select a row. The event object passed to the callback has a `preventDefault` method. Calling this
method will stop the row selection from happening, and the `onRowSelectEnd` event will never fire.

### Imperatively Adding Event Listeners

LyteNyte Grid's headless architecture allows developers to move the grid state higher up the React component
tree, and in a different place from where the `Grid.Root` component is declared. Rather that prop-drilling an
event handler, LyteNyte Grid's API allows for events to be Imperatively added. Events added in this way must
be cleaned up but they provide a nice way to add event listeners when the rendered grid is in a separate
component from the place where state is created. The example below demonstrates Imperatively adding an
event:

!demo:Imperative Event Listener="./demos/grid-imperative-event"

The behavior of the event listener is the same as the previous demo (every time a row is selected the user is
alerted), however the code to do so happens in a `useEffect`:

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  return grid.api.eventAddListener("rowSelectEnd", (p) => {
    alert(`The row with ID ${p.selected} was ${p.deselect ? "deselected" : "selected"}`);
  });
}, [grid.api]);
```

Notice the result of the `eventAddListener` method is returned. This value is a function that will remove the
event listener from the grid when the effect's clean up runs. In general the effect pattern above is what
should always be used when adding event listeners Imperatively.

### Differences From DOM Events

LyteNyte Grid's events are not the same as DOM events and do not behave the same. There is
no bubbling of events and the event object is specific to the event fired. Furthermore, the
event listeners can only be added through the grid API's `eventAddListener` or by adding
a listener to the `Grid.Root` component. For the most part these differences can safely be
ignored, but the difference is noted here to avoid confusion.

## Grid Component Event Listeners

If you review the list of events LyteNyte Grid fires in the [API reference](/docs/reference/events)
you will notice that all the events are specific to some grid interaction. There are not cell clicked
events, or grid scroll events. This is due to LyteNyte Grid's headless component architecture. The
grid components accept normal DOM event listeners, that can be used for all the standard interaction
you'd expect. There is no need to learn a separate event system for the type of interactions browsers
already define. For example, a scroll event listener may be added to the `Grid.Viewport` component to
track the current scroll position. The example below demonstrates this:

!demo:Listen To Scroll Event="./demos/grid-dom-events"

The code for the scroll listeners is the same code that all normal React elements accept. Your existing
React event knowledge perfectly translates to LyteNyte Grid's components.

```tsx
<Grid.Viewport
  onScroll={(ev) => {
    setScrollX(ev.currentTarget.scrollLeft);
    setScrollY(ev.currentTarget.scrollTop);
  }}
/>
```
