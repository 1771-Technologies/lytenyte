title: Responsive Container
description: LyteNyte Grid does not have intrinsic dimensions. The viewport
  fills its parent container, so the parent must have an
  intrinsic size for the grid to render correctly.
---

Despite not having an intrinsic size, LyteNyte Grid remains fully responsive.
To make the grid responsive, ensure its parent element is responsive.
This guide covers several ways to size the parent container.

<Callout>

Place LyteNyte Grid as the sole child of its container.
Do not include sibling elements.

## Pixel Value

Fixed pixel values for `height` and `width` provide the simplest sizing option but
limit flexibility. In most cases, set a fixed `height` and allow the
width to adjust based on the parent container. Set a fixed width only when necessary.

!demo:Pixel Height and Width="./demos/pixel-height-container"

The height of the grid viewport comes from the `div` that contains it, which uses
the following code:

```tsx
<div className="lng-grid" style={{ height: 500 }}>
  {/* Grid components */}
</div>
```

## Flex Height Containers

Flexbox layouts distribute space dynamically. When you assign `flex: 1` to a Flexbox child,
it expands to fill the available space. Because Flexbox containers grow with their content,
wrap LyteNyte Grid in an inner `div` with `position: absolute`, `width: 100%`,
and `height: 100%` to prevent the grid from increasing the container's height.
The grid then fills the space without overflow.

!demo:Flex Height Container="./demos/flex-height-container"

The flex height container uses a series of nested `div`s, as shown below:

```tsx
<div className="lng-grid" style={{ height: 500, display: "flex", flexDirection: "column" }}>
  <div style={{ flex: "1", position: "relative" }}>
    <div style={{ position: "absolute", width: "100%", height: "100%" }}>
      {/* Grid components */}
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Grid Height Containers

CSS Grid (not to be confused with LyteNyte Grid) provides a flexible layout system.
Within a grid container, LyteNyte Grid expands to fill its assigned
area while remaining properly contained.

!demo:Grid Height Container="./demos/grid-height-container"

The grid height container uses the `grid-template-rows` property, as shown below:

```tsx
<div className="lng-grid" style={{ display: "grid", gridTemplateRows: "500px" }}>
  {/* Grid components */}
</div>
```

Other CSS sizing techniques also work well with LyteNyte Grid.
Choose the approach that best fits your layout requirements.
