title: Responsive Container
description: LyteNyte Grid needs a container with explicitly defined dimensions. The
  HTMLElement hosting the Grid must have a specified height and
  width, even when empty.

This requirement still allows responsive layouts. The sections below
show effective ways to create containers that work well with LyteNyte
Grid.

<Callout>

Make LyteNyte Grid the sole child element inside its container. Do not
place sibling elements alongside it.

## Pixel Value

Setting fixed pixel values for `height` and `width` is the simplest
approach but offers limited flexibility. Often, you can fix the
`height` and let the width adjust automatically based on the parent
container. You can also set a fixed width if needed, though it's usually
unnecessary.

## Flex Height Containers

Flexbox layouts let containers distribute space dynamically. When you
assign `flex: 1` to a Flexbox child, it expands to fill the available
space. However, because Flexbox containers grow to fit their content,
you must ensure the grid doesn't add to the height. The simplest method
is to wrap the grid in a second `div` with `position: absolute`,
`width: 100%`, and `height: 100%`. LyteNyte Grid will then fill the
space without overflow or pushing beyond container boundaries.

## Grid Height Containers

CSS Grid (not to be confused with LyteNyte Grid) offers a flexible and versatile
layout system. Like Flexbox, LyteNyte Grid expands to fill its assigned space
within a grid container while keeping proper containment.

Additional CSS methods can also size containers for LyteNyte Grid
effectively. We encourage developers to experiment and choose the
solution that best meets their requirements.
