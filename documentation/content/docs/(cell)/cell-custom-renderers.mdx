  Customize cell display in LyteNyte Grid using React components directly or through registered
  renderers to control appearance and behavior.
---

Control how cells display content by setting the `cellRenderer` property on a column. This is the
main way to customize cell appearance in LyteNyte Grid.

The `cellRenderer` property accepts either:

- A React component (function or class).
- A string key that maps to a registered cell renderer.

## Direct Function Cell Renderer

Pass a React function component directly to `cellRenderer` to define how each cell in that column is
rendered.

!demo:Direct Cell Renderer="./demos/cell-renderers"

## Registering Cell Renderers

For reusability and cleaner column definitions, register cell renderers and reference them by key.
Pass a string to `cellRenderer` that matches a key in your registered renderers. Register renderers
through the `cellRenderers` property in grid state.

!demo:Registered Cell Renderer="./demos/cell-renderers-registered"

This pattern keeps column definitions serializable and makes renderers easier to reuse.

## Cell State

All rendered cells in LyteNyte Grid are React components and can use any React hook. However, cells
mount and unmount frequently as users scroll. Local component state will not persist between mounts.

To maintain persistent cell state across scrolling, manage the state at the grid level and pass it
down to individual cells.
