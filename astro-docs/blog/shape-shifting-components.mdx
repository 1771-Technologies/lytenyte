title: "Shape-Shifting Components: Mastering Render Props in React"
---

The **render prop** pattern in React is a familiar concept, but one that can introduce subtle issues. It
often leads to performance bottlenecks, increases garbage collection frequency, and may interfere
with otherwise stable third-party components. It can also slow your TypeScript language server,
causing IntelliSense to lag or become unresponsive, making your Editor feel like a janky mess.

Despite these drawbacks, nearly every UI component library offers some variant of the render prop
pattern. The reason is clear: it provides an impressive level of flexibility with relatively little DX overhead.
The experience is so smooth it often conceals the messy complexity underneath and the footguns
waiting for maintainers who aren't paying attention.

This post explores the render prop as a general concept and proposes what I believe to be a
practical, less surprising way to approach this pattern, particularly in UI component libraries. I'm not
introducing a new pattern in this post. I'm modernizing a good one that still holds up—just with fewer
sharp edges.

## About Me

I'm Lee, a software engineer with around decade of hands-on experience, primarily in the finance industry
at firms like Citadel and Jane Street.

I'm also the co-founder of [1771 Technologies](https://www.1771technologies.com/), where I'm building
[LyteNyte Grid](https://www.1771technologies.com/demo) a next-generation React
Data Grid built for developers who care about speed, stability, and clean API design.

## What This Post Covers

- The `as` prop: its purpose, its popularity, and reasons to move away from it.
- The `asChild` prop: made popular by the
  [Radix UI library](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/overview/introduction).
- Modern approaches to polymorphism in React components.
- Finally, the `useSlot` pattern: a stable, predictable alternative inspired by `asChild`.

This guide is intended to provide a more grounded understanding of the render prop pattern and how
to implement it effectively in a modern React codebase, without accidentally building a complexity
machine.

## Base Knowledge

Feel free to skip this section if you're already familiar with what a render prop is. This is intended
for newer React developers or anyone not yet comfortable with the pattern.

A render prop is simply a prop that accepts JSX or a function that returns JSX as its value. If you've
done any React development, you're already familiar with one common example: the `children` prop.
Consider these two equivalent snippets:

This is common knowledge: `children` is just a prop. React passes it automatically when you nest
components between opening and closing tags, but this is not a requirement. You could pass `children`
like any other prop.

You can also redefine `children` in your own component. For example, you can make the `children`
prop a function and handle calling it in your component:

```tsx
function MyComponent(props: { children: () => ReactNode }) {
  return <div>{props.children()}</div>;
}
```
