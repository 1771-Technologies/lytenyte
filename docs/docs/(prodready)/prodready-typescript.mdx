description: LyteNyte Grid provides first class TypeScript support. This guide will cover the
  best practices when working with TypeScript to extend LyteNyte Grid's column and API interfaces,
  and to avoid errors through properly type checking your code.

## The Main Grid Types

There are five primary types to know about when working with LyteNyte Grid:

- [`Grid.GridSpec`](/docs/reference/grid-spec): A type that is used a generic type constraint for some of the other type interfaces
  in the grid.
- [`Grid.Props`](/docs/reference/grid-props): The interface that describes the props that the `<Grid />`
  component accepts.
- [`Grid.Column`](/docs/reference/column): The base interface of a column in LyteNyte Grid.
- [`Grid.API`](/docs/reference/api): The interface that describes the base LyteNyte Grid API.
- [`RowSource`](/docs/reference/row-source): The base interface of a row data source that may be provided to the Grid. All the
  row data sources extend this base type.

You do not need to memorize these types, simply knowing how things
fit together will allow you to make the most out of TypeScript and LyteNyte Grid.

## The Grid Specification

Of the five primary types, the `Grid.GridSpec` type is usually defined by the developer. The `Grid.GridSpec`
is a type constraint used in the others, and is never used directly by LyteNyte Grid. The base definition
looks like this:

```ts
export interface GridSpec<
  Data = unknown,
  ColExt extends Record<string, any> = object,
  Source extends RowSource<Data> = RowSource,
  Ext extends Record<string, any> = object,
> {
  readonly data?: Data;
  readonly column?: ColExt;
  readonly source?: Source;
  readonly api?: Ext;
}
```

The specification has four optional type parameters and four optional properties. Each property extends
the Grid's typing in a particular way.

- The `Data` type describes the shape of the data that will be provided to the grid. For example, if the data
  provided to the grid is a `number[]`, it can be described in the grid spec as follows:

  ```ts
  interface GridSpec {
    readonly data: number[];
  }
  ```

- The `ColExt` type describes the additional properties on the columns that will be given to the grid
  will have. The additional properties are combined with the base `Grid.Column` type. For example, the
  following code shows two identical interfaces:

  ```ts
  interface GridSpec {
    readonly column: { readonly sort?: "asc" | "desc" | null };
  }

  type ColumnWithSort = Grid.Column<GridSpec>;

  interface ColumnWithSort extends Grid.Column {
    readonly sort?: "asc" | "desc" | null;
  }
  ```

  It's recommended to use the `GridSpec` approach, since we can define other types of extensions
  and provide a type for the data.

- The `Source` type describes the provided row data source. Whilst each type of row data source defines
  the same set of common capabilities, they also define source specific capabilities and functions. The
  source property ensures the capabilities are made known to the types in the grid. The code below
  shows an example using the `RowSourceServer` type from the
  [server row data source](/docs/server-data-loading-overview):

  ```ts
  interface GridSpec {
    readonly source: RowSourceServer;
  }
  ```

- The `Ext` type describes the extensions that the developer will provide to LyteNyte Grid via the
  `apiExtension` property on the grid. This property is used to provide user defined functions and
  state to the grid's API. By providing a type for the `Ext` on the grid spec, we can extend the API
  type. Furthermore the API type is always extended by the provided `RowSource` type, hence the final
  LyteNyte Grid API definition is the set of types formed by `Grid.API & Source & Ext`. Code example
  below shows an example of adding a `notifyUser` method to LyteNyte Grid's API:

  ```ts
  interface GridSpec {
    readonly api: { notifyUser: (msg: string) => void };
  }
  ```

All the properties can be combined to create a full specified set of grid types. For example, in the
code below each part of the `GridSpec` is defined and provided to the main types used by LyteNyte Grid.

```ts
interface GridSpec {
  readonly data: number[];
  readonly column: { readonly sort?: "asc" | "desc" | null };
  readonly source: RowSourceServer;
  readonly api: { notifyUser: (msg: string) => void };
}

type Props = Grid.Props<GridSpec>;
type Column = Grid.Column<GridSpec>;
type API = Grid.API<GridSpec>;
```

With these types defined, other derived types for specific properties can be defined. For example custom
renderer types can be created:

```ts
type CellRenderer = Required<Grid.Column<GridSpec>>["cellRenderer"]
type HeaderRenderer = Required<<Grid.Column<GridSpec>>["headerRenderer"]
```

## Grid is Namespace and Component

The `Grid` export in LyteNyte Grid is both the root component of LyteNyte Grid
