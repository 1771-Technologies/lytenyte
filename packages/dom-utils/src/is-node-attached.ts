  // If rootNode is shadow root, it'll have a host, which is the element to which the shadow
  //  is attached, and the one we need to check if it's in the document or not (because the
  //  shadow, and all nodes it contains, is never considered in the document since shadows
  //  behave like self-contained DOMs; but if the shadow's HOST, which is part of the document,
  //  is hidden, or is not in the document itself but is detached, it will affect the shadow's
  //  visibility, including all the nodes it contains). The host could be any normal node,
  //  or a custom element (i.e. web component). Either way, that's the one that is considered
  //  part of the document, not the shadow root, nor any of its children (i.e. the node being
  //  tested).
  // To further complicate things, we have to look all the way up until we find a shadow HOST
  //  that is attached (or find none) because the node might be in nested shadows...
  // If rootNode is not a shadow root, it won't have a host, and so rootNode should be the
  //  document (per the docs) and while it's a Document-type object, that document does not
  //  appear to be the same as the node's `ownerDocument` for some reason, so it's safer
  //  to ignore the rootNode at this point, and use `node.ownerDocument`. Otherwise,
  //  using `rootNode.contains(node)` will _always_ be true we'll get false-positives when
  //  node is actually detached.
  // NOTE: If `nodeRootHost` or `node` happens to be the `document` itself (which is possible
  //  if a tabbable/focusable node was quickly added to the DOM, focused, and then removed
  //  from the DOM as in https://github.com/focus-trap/focus-trap-react/issues/905), then
  //  `ownerDocument` will be `null`, hence the optional chaining on it.
