title: LyteNyte Doc MDX Walkthrough
---

## Headers

Headers create created using the `#` symbol. Each `#` is one level of the header.
HTML supports 6 levels of headers, however, only the first four are styled by
in LyteNyte Doc:

```mdx
# Header 1

## Header 2

### Header 3

#### Header 4

##### Header 5

###### Header 6
```

## Text

Normal text is converted into paragraph tags. The standard MD syntax for lists,
quotes, images, and tables is also supported.

```mdx

## Code Blocks

**Normal Code block**

```ts
let _id;
let fb_id: any;
fb_id = true;
fb_id = 23423523;

const firstName = "Tommy";
const lastName: string = "OneLife";
let isLoading: boolean;
isLoading = false;
```

**Highlights**

```ts {1, 3-4} del={7} ins={8}
let _id;
let fb_id: any;
fb_id = true;
fb_id = 23423523;

const firstName = "Tommy";
const lastName: string = "OneLife";
let isLoading: boolean;
isLoading = false;
```

**With Labels**

```ts {"1. this is a label on its own line":3} {4-5} {1} del={"2. This line is deleted":6} ins={"3. This line is inserted":9-11}
let _id;
let fb_id: any;

fb_id = true;
fb_id = 23423523;

const firstName = "Tommy";
const lastName: string = "OneLife";

let isLoading: boolean;
isLoading = false;
```

**Marking Individual Words**

```ts "isLoading"
let _id;
let fb_id: any;

fb_id = true;
fb_id = 23423523;

const firstName = "Tommy";
const lastName: string = "OneLife";

let isLoading: boolean;
isLoading = false;
```

**Word Wrap**

```js wrap hangingIndent=2
// Example with wrap
function getLongString() {
  return "This is a very long string that will most probably not fit into the available space unless the container is extremely wide";
}
```

```js wrap=false
// Example with wrap=false
function getLongString() {
  return "This is a very long string that will most probably not fit into the available space unless the container is extremely wide";
}
```

**Line numbers**

```ts "isLoading" showLineNumbers
let _id;
let fb_id: any;

fb_id = true;
fb_id = 23423523;

const firstName = "Tommy";
const lastName: string = "OneLife";

let isLoading: boolean;
isLoading = false;
```

```ts showLineNumbers startLineNumber=5
let _id;
let fb_id: any;

fb_id = true;
fb_id = 23423523;

const firstName = "Tommy";
const lastName: string = "OneLife";

let isLoading: boolean;
isLoading = false;
```

**Collapse Parts**

```ts collapse={1-5} collapse={9-11}
let _id;
let fb_id: any;

fb_id = true;
fb_id = 23423523;

const firstName = "Tommy";
const lastName: string = "OneLife";

let isLoading: boolean;
isLoading = false;
```

```ts collapse={1-5} collapse={9-11} showLineNumbers {"1":7}
let _id;
let fb_id: any;

fb_id = true;
fb_id = 23423523;

const firstName = "Tommy";
const lastName: string = "OneLife";

let isLoading: boolean;
isLoading = false;
```
