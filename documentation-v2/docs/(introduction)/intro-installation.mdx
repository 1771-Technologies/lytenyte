LyteNyte Grid is available in two editions:

- **Core Edition** ([Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)): Free, open-source edition that contains all the essential grid features.

- **PRO Edition** ([commercial license](https://www.1771technologies.com/eula)): Paid, enhanced edition that includes everything in Core, plus advanced
  capabilities for large-scale and complex use cases, such as server-side data loading, pivoting, tree data, and more.

Both editions can be installed from the NPM registry using your preferred package manager.

<PackageInstall package="@1771technologies/lytenyte-core" />

<PackageInstall package="@1771technologies/lytenyte-pro" />

## Upgrading to PRO

LyteNyte Grid PRO extends LyteNyte Grid Core. If you start with LyteNyte Grid Core and later
upgrade to PRO, you only need to update the package imports. Simply replace:

```ts
import { Grid } from "@1771technologies/lytenyte-core";
```

With:

```ts
import { Grid } from "@1771technologies/lytenyte-pro";
```

## Trial Licensing

The **PRO edition** requires a valid **Developer PRO** or **Organization PRO** license for production.

You can install and evaluate it without a license. The grid will remain fully functional,
but a persistent watermark will appear in both development and production.
To remove the watermark, activate your license key as explained in
the [License Activation guide](/docs/intro-license-activation).
