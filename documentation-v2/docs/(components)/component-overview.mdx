  intended for use with the grid, but can also be used as general-purpose components.

## Prebuilt Theming

The LyteNyte Grid components are unstyled by default. This provides you with an opportunity to add your own
styling or adopt an existing design system.

LyteNyte Grid provides pre-made styles for all components that leverage the existing LyteNyte Grid theme
tokens. To use these styles, ensure you import the following CSS file:

```css
import "@1771technologies/lytenyte-pro-experimental/components.css";
```

:::note
All the demos in the components guide use the `components.css` styles.

### Data Attributes

Like LyteNyte Grid, the components provided by LyteNyte Grid use `data-attributes` to
expose component state to CSS. You can use these `data-attributes` for your own styling
and logic.

The best way to determine which `data-attribute` to target is by inspecting the rendered
elements in the Chrome element inspector (or whichever browser devtools you are using).

## Slots

Many of the LyteNyte Grid components allow one or more props to accept a `SlotComponent`.
These props act as special render props that merge external props and event handlers with
internal ones. You can use these props to override how a component is displayed.

For example, the [Select All component](/docs/component-select-all) accepts a `slot` property
that you can use to override what the `SelectAll` component renders:

```tsx
<SelectAll slot={<div>My Custom Content</div>} />
```

The `SlotComponent`s also accept a function variant. When you provide a function, the component
passes additional state to that function. For example, the `SelectAll` component provides a
toggle function that changes the selection state.

```tsx
<SelectAll slot={(p) => <div onClick={() => p.toggle()}>My custom content</div>} />
```

The `SlotComponent` must be an element that accepts standard HTML props, such as `onClick`, or,
in the case of function slots, must return an element that accepts standard HTML props.
