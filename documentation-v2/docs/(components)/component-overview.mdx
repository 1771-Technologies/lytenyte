## Prebuilt Theming

LyteNyte Grid components are unstyled by default, so you can apply
your own styles or incorporate an existing design system.

LyteNyte Grid also provides prebuilt styles for every component, using the grid's
theme tokens. To use these styles, import the following CSS file:

```css
import "@1771technologies/lytenyte-pro-experimental/components.css";
```

### Data Attributes

Like the grid itself, LyteNyte Grid components use `data-attributes` to expose
component state to CSS. Use these attributes for custom styling and behavior.

To find relevant `data-attributes`, inspect the rendered elements in your browser's DevTools.

## Slots

Many components accept `SlotComponent` props to customize rendering. These render
props merge your props and event handlers with the component's
internal props and handlers, so you can control the rendered output.

For example, the [Select All component](/docs/component-select-all) accepts a `slot` property
that you can use to override what the `SelectAll` component renders:

```tsx
<SelectAll slot={<div>My Custom Content</div>} />
```

The `SlotComponent`s also accept a function variant. When you provide a function, the component
passes additional state to that function. For example, the `SelectAll` component provides a
toggle function that changes the selection state.

```tsx
<SelectAll slot={(p) => <div onClick={() => p.toggle()}>My custom content</div>} />
```

The `SlotComponent` must be an element that accepts standard HTML props, such as `onClick`, or,
in the case of function slots, must return an element that accepts standard HTML props.
