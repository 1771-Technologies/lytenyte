step: Render shadows for pin sections to add depth to your grid.
description: The viewport shadows slot in LyteNyte Grid is used to render shadows for pin
  sections in the grid to create visual depth.

## Shadows Slot

LyteNyte Grid exports the `ViewportShadows` component, which can be assigned to the
`slotShadows` property on the grid. The `ViewportShadows` component positions itself
within the viewport element of the grid.

The demo below shows the viewport shadows component in action. The pin areas have
borders drawn, and the end and bottom pin sections display a shadow. If you scroll
the grid vertically and horizontally, you will also see shadows appear for the
start and top sections.

::demo[Viewport Shadows="./demos/viewport-shadows"]

The code for the viewport shadows is shown below. Note that the `slotShadows` property
must be provided a component function and does not accept a React `Element`.

```tsx
<Grid rowHeight={50} columns={columns} rowSource={ds} slotShadows={ViewportShadows} />
```

The `ViewportShadows` component uses CSS to remain visible regardless of the grid's
scroll position. This behavior makes the component useful for drawing pin area
shadows. The shadows also avoid CSS stacking issues, which makes the component well
suited for adding visual depth without shadows being clipped.

## Styling Viewport Shadows

LyteNyte Grid components are unstyled by default. The `ViewportShadows` component
requires custom CSS to display visual feedback. If you are using a
[prebuilt LyteNyte Grid theme](/docs/grid-theming), the required styles are already applied.

To style or adjust the `ViewportShadows` component, target its data attributes.
The CSS used by the prebuilt themes is shown below and can be used as a reference
for custom styling.

The `data-ln-y-status` and `data-ln-x-status` data attributes have one of the following values:

- `"none"`: Set when the grid has no scroll applied. `x` represents horizontal scroll and `y` represents vertical scroll.
- `"partial"`: Set when some scroll has been applied to the grid.
- `"full"`: Set when the grid is fully scrolled in the direction. `x` represents horizontal scroll and `y` represents vertical scroll.

```css
[data-ln-viewport="true"] {
  & [data-ln-start-shadow],
  & [data-ln-end-shadow] {
    width: 5px;
    opacity: 0;
    transition: opacity 200ms ease-in-out;
    pointer-events: none;
  }

  & [data-ln-top-shadow],
  & [data-ln-bottom-shadow] {
    height: 8px;
    opacity: 1;
    transition: opacity 200ms ease-in-out;
    pointer-events: none;
  }

  & [data-ln-end-shadow] {
    transform: translateX(-5px);
  }

  &[data-ln-y-status="full"] [data-ln-top-shadow],
  &[data-ln-y-status="partial"] [data-ln-top-shadow] {
    opacity: 1;
    background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, var(--ln-border), transparent);
  }
  &[data-ln-y-status="none"] [data-ln-bottom-shadow],
  &[data-ln-y-status="partial"] [data-ln-bottom-shadow] {
    opacity: 1;
    background-image: linear-gradient(to top, var(--ln-border), transparent);
    transform: translateY(-8px);
  }

  &[data-ln-x-status="full"] [data-ln-start-shadow],
  &[data-ln-x-status="partial"] [data-ln-start-shadow] {
    opacity: 1;
    background-image: linear-gradient(to right, var(--ln-border), transparent);
  }

  &[data-ln-x-status="none"] [data-ln-end-shadow],
  &[data-ln-x-status="partial"] [data-ln-end-shadow] {
    opacity: 1;
    background-image: linear-gradient(to left, var(--ln-border-strong) 0, transparent);
  }
}
```

## Properties

The `ViewportShadows` component accepts the properties listed below. To apply these
properties, create an intermediate component. For example:

```tsx
function MyShadows() {
  return <ViewportShadows start={false} />;
}

<Grid rowHeight={50} columns={columns} rowSource={ds} slotShadows={MyShadows} />;
```

<TypeTable
  type={[
    {
      name: "start",
      description: "A boolean indicating if the start shadow should be drawn. By default `true`.",
      type: "boolean",
    },
    {
      name: "end",
      description: "A boolean indicating if the end shadow should be drawn. By default `true`.",
      type: "boolean",
    },
    {
      name: "top",
      description: "A boolean indicating if the top shadow should be drawn. By default `true`.",
      type: "boolean"
    },
    {
      name: "bottom",
      description: "A boolean indicating if the bottom shadow should be drawn. By default `true`.",
      type: "boolean"
    }

]}
/>
