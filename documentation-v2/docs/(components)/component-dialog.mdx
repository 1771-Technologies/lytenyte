pro: true
step: Display a dialog that requires the user's attention.
description: LyteNyte Grid exports a general purpose dialog component that can be
  used with the grid or within other parts of your application.
---

A **dialog** is a transient UI element that appears above the main content to present information
or request user interaction. A dialog temporarily interrupts the user's workflow to convey critical
context, prompt a decision, or collect input.

## Dialog Anatomy

LyteNyte Grid's dialog is a headless component composed of several parts that you must assemble
before use. The example below provides a brief overview of these parts.

```tsx
<Dialog>
  <Dialog.Trigger />

  <Dialog.Container>
    <Dialog.Arrow />
    <Dialog.Title />
    <Dialog.Description />

    <Dialog.Close />
  </Dialog.Container>
</Dialog>
```

## Dialog Example

The demo below shows a basic dialog. The displayed content represents the minimum required for a
fully accessible dialog. You can add additional content as needed to meet your application's
requirements.
