step: Streamline data selection using a versatile combobox or select element.
description: LyteNyte Grid's smart select component is a versatile combobox that supports
  single and multiple selection and asynchronous loading.
---

The `SmartSelect` component is a hybrid, headless combobox and select component. The selection
list uses a single, unified list box, while the selection trigger can be either a select trigger
or a combobox trigger.

## Single Select

The simplest variant of the `SmartSelect` component is the single select variant.
Set the `kind` property to `"basic"` and the `trigger` property to `SmartSelect.BasicTrigger`
to use the `SmartSelect` component in basic select mode.

The demo below demonstrates this configuration. The `value` and `options` properties are required.
Each `SmartSelect` option must have a unique ID.

::demo[Basic Single Select="./demos/smart-select-basic-demo"]

## Combo Select

Set the `kind` property to `"combo"` and the `trigger` property to `SmartSelect.ComboTrigger` to
use the `SmartSelect` component in combobox mode. A combobox allows users to search for an item
before selecting it.

The demo below shows the `SmartSelect` component used as a combobox. In this demo, the selected
value is used as the combobox input value, but this behavior is not required. In most cases,
a combobox is used to update the state of another component based on the selected value.

::demo[Combobox Select="./demos/smart-combo-demo"]

## Multiple Select

Set the `kind` property to `"multi"` and the `trigger` property to `SmartSelect.MultiTrigger` to
use the `SmartSelect` component in multi-select mode. Multi-select mode allows users to select
multiple items.

The `value` property must be provided as an array of options, unlike the basic select variant,
which accepts a single selected value.

The demo below shows multi-select in action. Selected items are rendered as `SmartSelect.Chip`
components. You must use `SmartSelect.Chip` for selected values to ensure the `SmartSelect`
component correctly handles keyboard navigation.

## Multiple Combobox

Set the `kind` property to `"multi-combo"` and the `trigger` property to
`SmartSelect.MultiComboTrigger` to use the `SmartSelect` component in multi-combobox mode.
Multi-combobox mode allows users to select multiple items using a combobox input.

The demo below shows multi-combobox in action. Selected items are rendered as
`SmartSelect.Chip` components. Users can type into the search input to add additional chips
to the current selection.

## Asynchronous Select

When the `SmartSelect` component uses a combobox trigger, the `options` property can return a
`Promise`. Returning a `Promise` places the `SmartSelect` component into search mode.

The demo below shows asynchronous searching. This approach is useful when options for a given
search query must be fetched from a server.

## Properties

The `SmartSelect` component is composed of several headless component parts. This section
describes the properties for headless components that define behavior beyond standard HTML
element properties.
