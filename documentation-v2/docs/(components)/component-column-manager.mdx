title: Column Manager
pro: true
step: Manage the visibility and order of columns using the Column Manager.
description: LyteNyte Grid provides an opinionated Column Manager component that can be
  used to control the visibility and order of columns in the grid.
---

Use the `ColumnManager` component as a simple way to provide a UI for managing columns in the
grid. The `ColumnManager` is opinionated by design and handles all the boilerplate required
for a functioning column management interface.

## Column Manager Example

The demo below demonstrates the Column Manager in action. You can toggle the visibility of a
column by clicking its checkbox. You can reorder columns by dragging them within the
Column Manager.

::demo[Column Manager="./demos/column-manager"]

Notice from the demo code that configuring the Column Manager is very simple. LyteNyte Grid's
Column Manager handles the complexity of managing column settings while providing a
very simple-to-use component.

```tsx
<ColumnManager columns={columns} onColumnsChange={setColumns} />
```

:::note

If you are looking for a component that is less opinionated, see the [Pill Manager](/docs/component-pill-manager) or
[Tree View](/docs/component-tree-view) components. These components are headless and allow
more flexible configuration.
