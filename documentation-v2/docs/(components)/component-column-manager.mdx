step: Manage the visibility and arrangement of grid columns.
description: Use an opinionated Column Manager component to handle column visibility and ordering.
---

Use the `ColumnManager` component to provide a UI for managing grid columns.
`ColumnManager` handles the common boilerplate for showing, hiding,
and reordering columns.

## Column Manager Implementation

The demo below shows the Column Manager. Click a checkbox to toggle a column's
visibility, or drag a column within the manager to reorder it.

::demo[Column Manager="./demos/column-manager"]

As shown in the demo code, configuring the Column Manager is straightforward. It
abstracts the complexity of column state management into a
single, easy-to-use component.

```tsx
<ColumnManager columns={columns} onColumnsChange={setColumns} />
```

:::note

For a less opinionated approach, use the [Pill Manager](/docs/component-pill-manager)
or [Tree View](/docs/component-tree-view). Both are headless and allow flexible configuration.

    },
