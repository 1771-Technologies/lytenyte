pro: true
step: Display additional content in a popover.
description: LyteNyte Grid exports a general purpose modern popover component. The popover
  component may be used in conjunction with the grid or with other components in your application.
---

A **popover** is a UI component that displays contextual content anchored to another element in the
interface, typically a button. A popover always appears as a result of a user action.

## Popover Anatomy

LyteNyte Grid's popover is a headless component composed of several parts that you must assemble
before use. The example below provides a brief overview of these parts.

```tsx
<Popover>
  <Popover.Trigger />

  <Popover.Container>
    <Popover.Arrow />
    <Popover.Title />
    <Popover.Description />

    <Popover.Close />
  </Popover.Container>
</Popover>
```

## Popover Example

The demo below shows a basic popover. The displayed content represents the minimum required for a
fully accessible popover. You can add additional content as needed to meet your application's
requirements.

::demo[Popover="./demos/popover-demo"]

## Properties

Popover elements accept standard HTML props. Some parts also support additional properties, which
are documented below.
