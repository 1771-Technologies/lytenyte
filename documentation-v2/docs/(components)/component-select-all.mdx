This guide assumes you are familiar with how row selection works in LyteNyte Grid.
See the [Row Selection guide](/docs/row-selection) for more details.

## Rendering Select All

LyteNyte Grid exports the `SelectAll` component. This component is intended for use in a
grid column header, but you can use it in any component that has access to the grid API.

The demo below shows the `SelectAll` component in action. The checkbox rendered in the marker
column header selects all rows when checked.

::demo[Select All="../(column)/demos/column-marker-selection"]

The code for the `SelectAll` component is shown below. The `Checkbox` component is also exported
from LyteNyte Grid and simplifies rendering indeterminate checkbox states. You may use your own
checkbox component if you prefer.

```tsx
<SelectAll
  api={params.api}
  slot={({ indeterminate, selected, toggle }) => {
    return (
      <Checkbox
        checked={selected}
        indeterminate={indeterminate}
        onClick={(ev) => {
          ev.preventDefault();
          toggle();
        }}
        onKeyDown={(ev) => {
          if (ev.key === "Enter" || ev.key === " ") toggle();
        }}
      />
    );
  }}
/>
```

### Why Use The Select All Component

The `SelectAll` component automatically manages all selection states for you.
LyteNyte Grid supports two selection modes: linked selection and isolated selection.
The logic for determining whether all rows are selected differs between these modes.

The `SelectAll` component abstracts these differences and provides a consistent interface
for determining whether all rows are selected, whether the selection state is indeterminate,
and for performing the correct select-all action.

## Properties

The `SelectAll` component accepts the following properties.

<TypeTable 
  type={[
    {
      name: "api",
      required: true,
      description: "An instance of the LyteNyte Grid API. If you render the `SelectAll` component " +
      "inside a LyteNyte Grid renderer, the API is available on the renderer props. Otherwise, obtain a " +
      "reference to the grid API via a `ref` and pass it to the `SelectAll` component.",
      type: "API",
    },
    {
      name: "slot",
      description: `A render prop used to render the checkbox contents. This value may be
        a React element or a function that receives the following parameters:
        - \`indeterminate\`: Whether the current selection state is indeterminate.
        - \`selected\`: Whether all rows are selected.
        - \`toggle\`: A function that toggles the select-all state.

        Use the \`slot\` property to override how the \`SelectAll\` component renders its UI.
      `,
      type: "SlotComponent",
    }
