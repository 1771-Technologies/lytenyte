title: Rows
description: "LyteNyte Grid has three types of rows: leaf, group, and aggregated. This reference
  details these row types."

## Row Node

The `RowNode` type represents a union of the three row types. While this section provides a
reference for each row type, grid APIs typically use the `RowNode` type rather than an
individual row type.

```ts
type RowNode<T> = RowLeaf<T> | RowGroup | RowAggregated;
```

For more details on row nodes, see the [Row Overview guide](/docs/row-overview).

## Row Leaf

<TypeTable
  type={[
    {
      name: "id",
      description: "A unique ID for the row. This ID is unique across all rows, regardless of grouping.",
      type: "string",
      required: true,
    },
    {
      name: "kind",
      description: "A type discriminant that narrows the `RowNode` type to a leaf row.",
      type: `"leaf"`,
      required: true,
    },
    {
      name: "loading",
      description:
        "Whether the row is currently in a loading state. A loading row may still contain data, but the data is likely stale.",
      type: `boolean`,
    },
    {
      name: "error",
      description:
        "An error associated with the row, often as a result of failing to load row data from the server.",
      type: "unknown",
    },
    {
      name: "parentId",
      description:
        "The ID of the parent row, if the row has a parent. This value is populated only when rows are grouped.",
      type: "string | null | undefined",
      required: true,
    },
    {
      name: "depth",
      description:
        "Indicates how deep the row is in the grouping hierarchy. A value of 0 indicates the row is at the root of the grouping tree.",
      type: "number",
      required: true,
    },
    {
      name: "data",
      description: "The data associated with the row.",
      type: "T",
      required: true,
    },
  ]}

## Row Group

<TypeTable

      required: true,
    },
    {
      name: "key",
      description:
        "The group key for the row. This value can be `null`, which indicates a blank value at this group level.",
      type: "string | null",
      required: true,
    },
    {
      name: "loading",
      description:
        "Whether the row is currently in a loading state. A loading row may still contain data, but the data is likely stale.",
      type: `boolean`,
    },
    {
      name: "error",
      description:
        "An error associated with the row, often as a result of failing to load row data from the server.",
      type: "unknown",
    },
    {
      name: "parentId",

      description: "Whether the row group is the last group at its grouping level.",
      type: "boolean",
      required: true,

      description: "Whether the row group is currently expanded.",
      type: "boolean",
      required: true,
    },
    {
      name: "expandable",
      description: "Whether the row group can be expanded.",

## Row Aggregated

    },
    {
      name: "parentId",
      description:

    },
    {
      name: "depth",
      description:
        "Indicates how deep the row is in the grouping hierarchy. A value of 0 indicates the row is at the root of the grouping tree.",
