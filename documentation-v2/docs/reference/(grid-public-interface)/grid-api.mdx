title: Grid API
description: Use the API methods to query grid state and run operations programmatically.
---

:::warn

Avoid calling API methods in the render path of a React component. To prevent state issues,
use API methods in callbacks or effects unless you have
an advanced understanding of the grid's state flow.

:::

## Getting the API

LyteNyte Grid provides the API as a prop to all renderers and event callbacks
exposed by the grid. If you need to use the API in other parts of your application,
provide the grid with a `ref` prop to access the API directly.

```tsx
const apiRef = useRef();

return <Grid ref={apiRef} />;
```

## Extending the API

You can extend the LyteNyte Grid API with custom properties to add new capabilities and
simplify integration of the grid into your application. The code below shows a basic
example. See the [API Extension guide](/docs/grid-api-extensions) for more details.

```tsx
interface GridSpec {
  readonly api: { notify: () => void };
}

type MyExtendedAPI = Grid.API<GridSpec>=

function MyGrid() {
  const apiExtension = useMemo(() => {
    return {
      notify: () => {
        // Do something
      }
    }
  }, [])

  return <Grid apiExtension={apiExtension} />
}
```

## Grid API Properties

The properties listed below are grouped into sections, but they are all available on the same API
instance.

:::note

LyteNyte Grid's API is further extended by the row source provided to the grid. In addition to the
properties listed below, the row source properties are also available on the API instance.
See the [Row Source reference](/docs/reference/row-source) for more details.
