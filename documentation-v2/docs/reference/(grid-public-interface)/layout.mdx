## Row Layouts

Two layout types are necessary to describe a row's layout:

1. **Full Width Layout:** Used for full width rows.
2. **Cell Layout:** Used for rows with individual cells.

The `LayoutRow` type defines the row layout as a union of the cell and full-width layout types.

```ts
type LayoutRow = LayoutRowWithCells | LayoutFullWidthRow;
```

### LayoutFullWidthRow

  type={[
    {
      name: "kind",

## Header Layouts

Three layout types are necessary to describe a header's layout:

1. **Header group cell**
2. **Header cell**
3. **Floating header cell**

The `LayoutHeader` type defines the header layout as a union of these types.

```ts
type LayoutHeader = LayoutHeaderCell | LayoutHeaderFloating | LayoutHeaderGroup;
```
