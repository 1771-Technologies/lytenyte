title: Rows
description: LyteNyte Grid has three types of rows, leaf, group, and aggregated. This reference
  details the types on these rows.
---

## Row Node

The `RowNode` type represents a union of the three different row types. Whilst this section provides a
reference for three row types, you will generally see the usage of `RowNode` in grid types instead of an
individual type.

```ts
type RowNode<T> = RowLeaf<T> | RowGroup | RowAggregated;
```

For more details on row nodes see the [Row Overview guide](/docs/row-overview).

## Row Leaf

<TypeTable
  type={[
    {
      name: "id",
      description:
        "A unique ID for this row. This ID will be unique across all rows regardless of the grouping.",
      type: "string",
      required: true,
    },
    {
      name: "kind",
      description: "A type discriminant to narrow the type of `RowNode` to the leaf row type.",
      type: `"leaf"`,
      required: true,
    },
    {
      name: "loading",
      description:
        "Whether the row is currently in a loading state. A loading state may still have data, but the data is likely stale.",
      type: `boolean`,
    },
    {
      name: "error",
      description:
        "An error associated with the row, often as result of failing to load the rows data from the server.",
      type: "unknown",
    },
    {
      name: "parentId",
      description:
        "The ID of the parent row, if the row has a parent. This will only be populated if rows a grouped.",
      type: "string | null | undefined",
      required: true,
    },
    {
      name: "depth",
      description:
        "Indicates how deep in the grouping hierarchy the row is. A value of 0 indicates the row is at the root of the grouping tree.",
      type: "number",
      required: true,
    },
    {
      name: "data",
      description: "Any data associated with the row.",
      type: "T",
      required: true,
    },
  ]}

## Row Group

<TypeTable

      required: true,
    },
    {
      name: "key",
      description:
        "The group key of the row. This can be `null` indicating a blank value for this group level.",
      type: "string | null",
      required: true,
    },
    {
      name: "loading",
      description:
        "Whether the row is currently in a loading state. A loading state may still have data, but the data is likely stale.",
      type: `boolean`,
    },
    {
      name: "error",
      description:
        "An error associated with the row, often as result of failing to load the rows data from the server.",
      type: "unknown",
