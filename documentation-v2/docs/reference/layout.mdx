title: Layout
description: LyteNyte Grid is a headless data grid. The cells and headers of the grid
  are positioned based a layout description. This section describes the different types
  that make up the layout description of the grid.

For more details on working with LyteNyte Grid as a headless grid see
the [Headless Component Parts guide](/docs/grid-headless-parts).

## Row Layouts

Two types are necessary to describe the layout of a row in LyteNyte, since a row
may either be a full width row or a row with individual cells. The row layout is described by a type
called `LayoutRow`, which is a union of the cells layout or full width layout types:

```ts
type LayoutRow = LayoutRowWithCells | LayoutFullWidthRow;
```

### LayoutFullWidthRow

<TypeTable
  type={[
    {
      name: "kind",
      description: "A type discriminant to distinguish the full width layout row from other layout types.",
      type: '"full-width"',
      required: true,
    },
    {
      name: "id",
      description: "The unique ID of the row.",
      type: "string",

## Header Layouts

Three types are necessary to describe the header layout. The types describe the header group cell,
header cell, or floating header cell. The `LayoutHeader` type is a union of these three types.

```ts
type LayoutHeader = LayoutHeaderCell | LayoutHeaderFloating | LayoutHeaderGroup;
```
