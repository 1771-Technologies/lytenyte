title: API Reference
description: LyteNyte Grid provides a comprehensive API designed to support its wide range of features.
  The API Reference provides technical coverage and type descriptions of the grid's public interface.
---

LyteNyte Grid's public API can be divided into six main sections:

- [Grid Props](/docs/reference/grid-props): Properties passed to the grid component. These properties
  configure and customize LyteNyte Grid behavior.
- [Grid API](/docs/reference/grid-api): Methods exposed by LyteNyte Grid for advanced functionality.
  The Grid API allows imperative interaction with the grid.
- [Column](/docs/reference/column): An overview of the grid's column specification. Columns define
  what LyteNyte Grid displays.
- [Row](/docs/reference/row): An overview of the different row types in LyteNyte Grid. Rows define
  how LyteNyte Grid retrieves data for cells.
- [Layout](/docs/reference/layout): A description of the layout objects used to assemble LyteNyte Grid
  when running in [headless mode](/docs/grid-headless-parts).
- [Grid Types](/docs/reference/grid-types): Auxiliary types used by LyteNyte Grid's functions,
  methods, and properties.

Separate from the grid is the row source, which provides the interface the grid uses to query and
interact with row data. LyteNyte Grid provides several row sources out of the box:

- [Client Row Source](/docs/reference/client-row-source): A row source for data that exists on the client.
- [Server Row Source](/docs/reference/server-row-source): A row source for loading data in slices from a server.
- [Tree Row Source](/docs/reference/tree-row-source): A row source for rendering and editing hierarchical,
  object-based data.

Finally, LyteNyte Grid provides a set of utility functions that enhance the grid's functionality:

- The [Piece utility](/docs/reference/piece-utility) creates stable references from unstable state
  sources that can be shared with LyteNyte Grid and other components.
- [Other small utility functions](/docs/reference/utility-functions), such as `equal`, make it easier
  to build advanced use cases with LyteNyte Grid.

Each reference page contains the descriptions and type information required to use LyteNyte Grid's
public API. For learning how to use LyteNyte Grid in practice, see the
[dedicated guides](/docs/intro-getting-started). Use the reference section as a quick lookup for
method and function details.
