## Grid Public Interface

LyteNyte Grid's public API has six sections:

- [Grid Props](/docs/reference/grid-props): Properties passed to the grid component to configure and customize grid behavior.
- [Grid API](/docs/reference/grid-api): Methods exposed by the grid to allow imperative interaction.
- [Column](/docs/reference/column): Define column specifications and what the grid displays.
- [Row](/docs/reference/row): Define row types that dictate how the grid retrieves and renders data for cells.
- [Layout](/docs/reference/layout): Objects used to assemble the grid when running in headless mode.
- [Grid Types](/docs/reference/grid-types): Auxiliary types used by the grid's functions, methods, and properties.

## Grid Row Source

The **row source** is a separate interface that the grid uses to query
and interact with row data. LyteNyte Grid provides several
built-in row sources:

- [Row Source](/docs/reference/row-source): An overview of the row data source interface.
- [Client Row Source](/docs/reference/client-row-source): A row source for data that exists on the client.
- [Server Row Source](/docs/reference/server-row-source): A row source for loading data in slices from a server.
- [Tree Row Source](/docs/reference/tree-row-source): A row source for rendering and editing hierarchical,
  object-based data.

## Grid Utility Functions

LyteNyte Grid provides a set of utility functions
that enhance the grid's functionality:

- [Piece utility](/docs/reference/piece-utility): Creates stable references from unstable state
  sources that can be shared with the grid and other components.
- [Utility Functions](/docs/reference/utility-functions): Includes other small utility functions, such as `equal`,
  to simplify building advanced use cases within the grid.

## Reference vs. Guides

Each reference page provides descriptions and type information required to use the public API.
Use this API reference section as a quick lookup for method and function details, and
consult the [Guides](/docs/intro-getting-started) to learn how to implement LyteNyte Grid in practice.
