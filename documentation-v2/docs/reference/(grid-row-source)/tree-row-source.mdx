title: Tree Row Source
pro: true
description: LyteNyte Grid's tree row source extends the base row source with
  additional capabilities for viewing object-based data.
---

Use the tree data source when the data the grid should render is a hierarchical
object. See the [Tree Overview guide](/docs/tree-source-overview) for more details.

## Tree Source Params

To create a tree row source, use the `useTreeDataSource` hook exported by LyteNyte Grid.
This hook accepts parameters that configure the tree source view.

<TypeTable
  type={[
    {
      name: "topData",
      description: "The rows pinned to the top of the tree view.",
      type: "(RowLeaf | RowAggregated)[]",

## Tree Source API Additions

The tree row source extends the grid API with the following additional properties.

<TypeTable
  type={[
    {
      name: "rowUpdate",
      description: "Updates the value of rows in the tree data source.",
      type: "(rows: Map<RowNode<T>, T>) => void",
    },
  ]}
/>
