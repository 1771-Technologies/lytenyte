## Filtering Infinite Rows

To filter rows on the server, define a filter model and include it in each data request.
Include the filter model in the `queryKey` of the `useServerDataSource` hook.
Whenever the filter model changes, the grid requests a new set of rows from the server as the user scrolls.

The following demo passes a custom filter model to the `queryKey` of the server data source. Click the
funnel icon in a column header to apply a filter.

[Server Row Filtering guide](/docs/server-data-loading-row-filtering).
