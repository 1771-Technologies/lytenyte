## Sorting Infinite Rows

To sort rows on the server, define a sort model and send it with each request.
The `useServerDataSource` hook accepts the sort model as part of the `queryKey`.
The sort model can use any structure that fits your application.
In most cases, match the format your server or database expects.

The demo below shows infinite row sorting. **Click** a column header to
update that column's sort state.

::demo[Sort Infinite Rows="./demos/server-sorting"]

The demo code applies sort state to columns. By extending the [grid's API](/docs/grid-api-extensions),
you can update the `sort` property on each column directly. The extended API then applies the appropriate
sort when the user clicks a column header.
