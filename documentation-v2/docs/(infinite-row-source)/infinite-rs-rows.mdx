Infinite row loading uses the server data source. This guide assumes
you're familiar with the concepts covered in
the [Server Row Overview guide](/docs/server-data-loading-overview).

## Infinite Row Loading

Infinite row loading detects when a user scrolls near the end of the viewport.
Once the scroll position reaches a defined threshold, the grid requests
the next data slice.

The example below uses the grid's `events` property to register a `scrollEnd` listener.
The listener checks whether the scroll position is within 100px of the total scroll height.

```tsx
<Grid
  events={useMemo<Grid.Events<GridSpec>>(() => {
    return {
      viewport: {
        scrollEnd: ({ viewport }) => {
          const top = viewport.scrollTop;
          const left = viewport.scrollHeight - viewport.clientHeight - top;
          if (left < 100) {
            const req = ds.requestsForView.get().at(-1)!;
            const next = { ...req, start: req.end, end: req.end + 100 };
            ds.pushRequests([next]);
          }
        },
      },
    };
  }, [ds])}
/>
```

This example shows one approach to implementing infinite row loading. The key implementation
detail is creating a request for the next data slice and calling `ds.pushRequests` to fetch it.
For more details, see the [Data Interface guide](/docs/server-data-loading-interface).

The demo below demonstrates infinite data loading using this approach.
When you scroll near the end of the grid, the grid loads additional rows after a brief delay.
