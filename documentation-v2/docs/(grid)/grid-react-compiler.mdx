step: See how to use the React compiler with LyteNyte Grid to automatically memoize props.
description: LyteNyte Grid, built in React for React, requires no special configuration
  to start using the React compiler. Simply set up the compiler as
  part of your build process, and it will work seamlessly.

## Why Use the Compiler?

LyteNyte Grid accepts props that are not simple primitive JavaScript values.
For example, `columns` property is provided as an array. When you pass non-memoized props to the grid,
LyteNyte Grid may perform unnecessary re-renders, degrading performance.
To illustrate, the following simple code can result in performance loss.

```tsx
<Grid columnBase={{ width: 100 }} />
```

Every time the component re-renders, React creates a new `columnBase` object. When the `columnBase`
value changes, LyteNyte Grid needs to recompute the row and cell layout. As a result, every element in the
grid will re-render. One re-render won't impact performance, but if the component re-renders
many times, the performance of your application will quickly degrade.

It's worth noting that this performance issue is not specific to LyteNyte Grid. React behaves this way,
and every React developer must address it whether or not they use LyteNyte Grid. The fix is simple:
memoize the value using `useMemo`.

```tsx
<Grid columnBase={useMemo(() => ({ width: 100 }), [])} />
```

Since memoizing values is so common, and in complex applications becomes difficult to manage,
the React team created the [React compiler](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/introduction) to
automatically optimize React code.

When you use the React compiler, you no longer need to worry about memoizing values manually. As a result,
code like the following is no longer a performance bottleneck. The compiler will optimize it for you.

```tsx
<Grid columnBase={{ width: 100 }} />
```

For more on the React compiler, see the [React introduction docs](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/introduction).
If the React compiler works for your project, it is recommended to adopt it.
