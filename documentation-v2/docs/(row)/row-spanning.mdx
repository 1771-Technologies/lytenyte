title: Row Spanning
step: Span cells across multiple rows.
description: Cells can span multiple rows in LyteNyte Grid. When a cell spans, it occupies the rows beneath it, and the grid does not render the cells it covers.
---

The `rowSpan` property on a column definition controls how many rows a cell spans. It accepts either a
number or a function.

- **Provide a number** to apply the same span to every row.
- **Provide a function** that returns a number to vary the span per row.

Cells always span downward toward the bottom of the viewport. A spanning cell covers cells in
subsequent rows, never previous rows.

## Uniform Row Spans

When `rowSpan` is a **number**, every cell in the column spans the same number of rows. The grid skips
rendering any cells covered by the span. The demo below shows the **Symbol** column spanning two rows.
The first row in each span represents the current value, while the second row represents the previous
value.

The meaning of a span depends on your use case, but fixed numeric spans are relatively uncommon and
should be used with caution.

::demo[Uniform Row Spans="./demos/row-spanning-number"]

Define a two-row span directly within the column definition:

```ts
const columns = [
  // other columns
  { id: "symbol", rowSpan: 2 },
];
```

## Function Row Spans

Set `rowSpan` to a **function** to compute spans dynamically per row. This allows spans based on row
data. The demo below groups cryptocurrencies by exchange, with the **Exchange** column spanning all
rows that share the same exchange value.

::demo[Function Row Spans="./demos/row-spanning-fn"]

The span for each exchange is computed ahead of time. The column then uses a span function to return
the correct value, as shown below:

```ts
{
  id: "symbol",
  cellRenderer: SymbolCell,
  width: 250,
  name: "Symbol",
  //!next 4
  rowSpan: (r) => {
    const exchange = r.row.data?.exchange as string;
    return exchangeCounts[exchange] ?? 1;
  },
}
```

## Row Scan Distance

For performance, LyteNyte Grid does not precompute spans for all rows ahead of time. Instead, it scans backward from
the first visible row to determine which cells should span. The grid scans a specific number of rows before the first
visible row based on the `rowScanDistance` property. You can change `rowScanDistance` to tune span calculation
performance. The default scan distance is 50, which is usually sufficient for most use cases.

```tsx
// Change scan lookback to 100.
<Grid rowScanDistance={100} />
```

The `rowScanDistance` value sets the maximum row span that a cell is allowed to have. The value returned by the `rowSpan`
property on the column must not exceed `rowScanDistance`. If `rowSpan` exceeds `rowScanDistance`, LyteNyte Grid cannot
guarantee that it will hide the cells covered by the span.

:::info

LyteNyte Grid uses a scan-based approach to optimize correctness and
performance. Unlike grids that precompute spans, which limit scalability, or
render spans inaccurately when scrolling, LyteNyte Grid requires setting a maximum
span to maintain accuracy and performance.
