## Enabling Row Selection

The `rowSelectionMode` property on the LyteNyte Grid state object configures which
row selection behavior the grid should use. It accepts one of the following values:

- `"none"`: Disables all built-in row selection behavior and prevents user interactions
  from selecting rows. Developers may still select rows programmatically.
- `"single"`: Allows the user to select a single row. Selecting a new row clears any existing selection.
- `"multiple"`: Allows multiple rows to be selected, including additive selection behavior.

In addition to `rowSelectionMode`, the `rowSelectionActivator` property controls
which user action selects a row. It accepts one of the following values:

- `"none"`: Disables all row-based selection interactions. Developers must provide
  a custom selection mechanism, such as selection checkboxes.
- `"single-click"`: Selects a row when the user clicks it.
- `"double-click"`: Selects a row when the user double-clicks it.

The demo below shows single-row selection configured to select a row with
a single click. Other configurations, covered in later sections, support
multiple selection modes or checkbox-based selection.

!demo:Enabling Row Selection="./demos/row-selection_x"

### Multiple Row Selection

Set `rowSelectionMode` to `"multiple"` to allow users to select more than one row.
Clicking a row toggles its selection state. Holding **Shift** while clicking
another row selects the range between the two rows.

The demo below demonstrates these interactions.

!demo:Multiple Row Selection="./demos/row-selection-multi_x"

The following configuration enables multiple row selection using single-click activation:

```ts
const grid = Grid.useLyteNyte({
  // Other grid props
  rowSelectionMode: "multiple",
  rowSelectionActivator: "single-click",
});
```

## Checkbox Selection

Selecting rows by clicking anywhere on the row can conflict with other grid interactions or diverge
from common UX patterns. A common alternative is checkbox-based row selection.

LyteNyte Grid provides the `api.rowHandleSelect` helper to simplify checkbox selection logic,
including support for shift-based range selection.

!demo:Checkbox Row Selection="./demos/row-selection-checkbox_x"

The demo uses `api.rowHandleSelect` to handle checkbox interactions:

```tsx
<GridCheckbox
  onClick={(ev) => {
    ev.stopPropagation();
    grid.api.rowHandleSelect({ shiftKey: ev.shiftKey, target: ev.target });
  }}
  onKeyDown={(ev) => {
    if (ev.key === "Enter" || ev.key === " ")
      grid.api.rowHandleSelect({ shiftKey: ev.shiftKey, target: ev.target });
  }}
/>
```

### Selecting All Rows

The checkbox demo also supports selecting all rows using a header checkbox. This
behavior uses the [`grid.api.rowSelectAll`](/docs/reference/grid-api#gridapi) method. You can call
this method to select or deselect all rows
currently known to the grid.

## Group Row Selection

Row groups form hierarchical relationships with their child rows,
but each group row maintains its own selection state. By default,
selecting a group row does not affect the selection state of its children.

You can change this behavior using the `rowSelectChildren` property on the grid state.
In the example below, selecting a group row also selects all of its child rows.

!demo:Row Group Selection="./demos/row-selection-groups_x"

## Row Selection State

The `rowSelectionIds` property controls which rows are selected.
It is a set of string values, where each value represents a row ID.

The set may contain IDs that do not yet correspond to existing rows.
This allows you to preselect rows before they are created or loaded.
The demo below shows how to initialize the grid with a predefined selection state.

!demo:Row Selection State="./demos/row-selection-state_x"

## Preventing Row Selection

LyteNyte Grid fires the `rowSelectBegin` event when row selection
begins. You can use this event to prevent specific rows from being selected.

This is demonstrated in the demo below, where the
grid prevents selecting rows with odd indices.

!demo:Prevent Row Selection="./demos/row-selection-preventing_x"

The following example shows how to cancel row selection using this event.
For more information about grid events, see the [Grid Events guide](/docs/grid-events).

```tsx
<Grid.Root
  grid={grid}
  onRowSelectBegin={({ preventDefault, selected }) => {
    if (Number.parseInt(selected) % 2) {
      preventDefault();
      alert(`Selection of the row at index \${Number.parseInt(selected)} has been prevented.`);
    }
  }}
>
  {/* other parts */}
</Grid.Root>
```
