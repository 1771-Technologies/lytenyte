  Pinned rows remain visible as the user scrolls.

## Pinned Row Specifications

The grid's data source defines which rows are pinned. How you specify pinned rows
depends on the type of row data source in use.

The demo below uses the [client row data source](/docs/client-source-overview) to
demonstrate row pinning. For other data sources, see their respective guides:

- [Tree Data Source](/docs/tree-source-overview)
- [Server Row Pinning](/docs/server-data-loading-overview)

::demo[Pinned Rows="./demos/row-pinning"]

## Pinned Row Indices

LyteNyte Grid assigns row indices sequentially from top to bottom.
When the grid includes pinned rows, the first row index belongs to the first top-pinned row,
and the final index belongs to the last bottom-pinned row.

This indexing model has an important implication. When rows are pinned to the top, the row indices of scrollable
rows are offset by the number of top-pinned rows. This matters when you work with rows by index, such as when
retrieving a row programmatically. To access the first scrollable row by index,
you must account for the number of rows pinned at the top.

The marker column demo below makes this behavior explicit:

::demo[Offset Pinned Rows="./demos/row-pinning-marker"]

In this example, the first scrollable row displays an index of `3` because two rows are pinned to the top.
The bottom-pinned rows display indices `17` and `18`, reflecting their position after both the
top-pinned and scrollable rows.
