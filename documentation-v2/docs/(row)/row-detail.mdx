## Enabling Row Detail

Row detail functionality in LyteNyte Grid is always enabled. Any row can display a detail section.
To create a detail section, define a `rowDetailRenderer` on the grid state object. LyteNyte Grid uses
this renderer to render the content of each row's detail area.

The demo an example of row detail in action. The [marker column](/docs/marker-column) renders a detail toggle.
The toggle calls `api.rowDetailToggle`, which adds or removes the row ID from the `rowDetailExpansions` set,
which determines the rows that have an expanded row detail area.

## Row Detail Height

Use `rowDetailHeight` property on the grid to control the height of the detail section.
The `rowDetailHeight` property accepts one of the following values:

- **Number**: A fixed height in pixels.
- **Auto**: The string value `"auto"`, which sizes the detail section based on its content.

By default, the grid uses a numeric height. Use `"auto"` when the detail content should determine
its own height.

## Nested Grids

A common use case for row detail is rendering nested grids or tables. In this pattern, a master grid
expands to reveal a child grid within the detail area. LyteNyte Grid supports this pattern by allowing
a grid to be rendered inside a row detail section.

The demo below shows a nested grid rendered inside the detail area of a row:

::demo[Nested Grid Row Detail="./demos/row-detail-nested"]

A nested grid is not a special case. To create one, have the detail renderer return another grid
instance. LyteNyte Grid places no restrictions on what the detail renderer can display.

## Controlled Detail Expansion State

The `rowDetailExpansions` property on the grid determines which rows have their detail area
expanded. If you do not set `rowDetailExpansions` on the grid, LyteNyte Grid tracks detail
expansion using internal, uncontrolled state.

By providing a `rowDetailExpansions` value, you can control which rows have their detail area
expanded in a way that matches your application's desired behavior. Then, by listening to
`onRowDetailExpansionChange`, you can update your controlled expansion state.

For example, you can restrict the grid to allow at most one expanded detail area at a time.
Expanding another row's detail area collapses any other open detail areas.
The demo below demonstrates this.
