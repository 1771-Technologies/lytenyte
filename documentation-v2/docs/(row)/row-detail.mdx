## Enabling Row Detail

Row detail functionality in LyteNyte Grid is always enabled. Any row can display a detail section.
To create a detail section, define a `rowDetailRenderer` on the grid state object. LyteNyte Grid uses
this renderer to render the content of each row's detail area.

After defining a detail renderer, populate the `rowDetailExpansions` set on the grid state to control
which rows display their detail sections. `rowDetailExpansions` contains the row IDs of rows whose detail
areas are expanded.

The demo below shows this behavior. The [marker column](/docs/marker-column) renders a detail toggle.
The toggle calls `grid.api.rowDetailToggle`, which adds or removes the row ID from the
`rowDetailExpansions` set.

## Auto Row Detail Height

Use `rowDetailHeight` to control the height of the detail section. The `rowDetailHeight` property
accepts one of the following values:

- **Number**: A fixed height in pixels.
- **Auto**: The string value `"auto"`, which sizes the detail section based on its content.

By default, the grid uses a numeric height. Use `"auto"` when the detail content should determine
its own height.

## Nested Grids

A common use case for row detail is rendering nested grids or tables. In this pattern, a master grid
expands to reveal a child grid within the detail area. LyteNyte Grid supports this pattern by allowing
a grid to be rendered inside a row detail section.

The demo below shows a nested grid rendered inside the detail area of a row:

!demo:Nested Grid Row Detail="./demos/row-detail-nested_x"

A nested grid is not a special case. To create one, have the detail renderer return another grid
instance. LyteNyte Grid places no restrictions on what the detail renderer can display.

## Next Steps

- [Row Height](/docs/row-height): Change row height, including variable-height and fill-height rows.
- [Row Pinning](/docs/row-pinning): Freeze rows at the top or bottom of the viewport.
- [Row Selection](/docs/row-selection): Select single or multiple rows.
- [Row Full Width](/docs/row-full-width): Create rows that span the full width of the viewport.
