title: Row Full Width
step: Create rows that span the full width of the viewport.
description: Create full width rows in LyteNyte Grid that render a single cell spanning the entire viewport.

## Full Width Row Predicate

Use `rowFullWidthPredicate` property on the grid to determine whether a row renders as a full width row.
A full width row spans the entire viewport and replaces the standard row that would otherwise render
in the same position.

Full width rows always span the viewport and remain visible during horizontal scrolling. Use them for
section headers, summary rows, or other specialized content within the grid.

In the demo below, full width rows group data by the exchange on which each crypto symbol trades. This
pattern is a common use case for full width rows.

::demo[Full Width Rows="./demos/row-full-width"]

The demo uses `rowFullWidthRenderer` to provide a React component for rendering full width rows. This
renderer can return any React component. In the demo, the component renders the exchange name and logo
centered within the row, as shown below.

```tsx
function FullWidthCell({ api, row }: Grid.T.RowFullWidthRendererParams<GridSpec>) {
  if (!api.rowIsLeaf(row) || !row.data) return null;

  const name = row.data.exchange;
  const image = exchanges[name];

  return (
    <div className="bg-ln-gray-05 flex h-full w-full items-center justify-center gap-1.5 text-xs">
      <div>
        <img src={image} alt={`Logo for exchange ${name}`} className="size-5 overflow-hidden rounded-full" />
      </div>
      <div className="overflow-hidden text-ellipsis">{name}</div>
    </div>
  );
}
```
