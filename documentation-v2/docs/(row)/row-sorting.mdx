## Sort Model

LyteNyte Grid defines sorting through the `sortModel` property on the grid state. The grid does not
sort data directly. Instead, the row data source applies the sort and returns the sorted rows.
`sortModel` is an array of sort configurations.

LyteNyte Grid supports built-in sort types and custom sort implementations.
Each item in the `sortModel` conforms to the [`SortModelItem`](/docs/reference/sort#sortmodelitem)
interface. An example appears below:

```tsx
{ columnId: "age", sort: { kind: "number" }, isDescending: false },
```

This guide describes the sort model as a generic representation of sort state. The data source you
provide remains responsible for applying the sort. The demo below shows this behavior using the
[client row data source](/docs/row-client-data-source).

For a server-driven example, see the
[Server Row Sorting guide](/docs/server-data-loading-row-sorting), which sorts data on a mock server
before returning results to the client.

Click a column header in the demo to cycle through the available sort states.

## Multi-Column Sort

Since the `sortModel` is an array, you can define multiple sort rules to create a multi-column sort:

1. The first item in the array has the highest priority.
2. If values are equal, the next sort rule applies, and so on.

In the demo below, hold **Ctrl** (Windows/Linux) or **Command** (macOS) while clicking a column header
to add it to the sort model. See the example's `Header` component for one way to implement this
interaction.

If your application already performs an action when a column header is clicked, or if Ctrl+click to add more sorts feels unintuitive,
LyteNyte Grid provides a [Sort Manager](/docs/component-sort-manager) to handle multi-sorting in a user-friendly way.
Consider using it when your grid requires sorting across multiple dimensions.

## Next Steps

- [Row Height](/docs/row-height): Change row height, including variable-height and fill-height rows.
- [Row Pinning](/docs/row-pinning): Freeze rows at the top or bottom of the viewport.
- [Row Full Width](/docs/row-full-width): Create rows that span the full width of the viewport.
- [Row Selection](/docs/row-selection): Select single or multiple rows.
