description: Learn how the LyteNyte grid creates, renders, and manages rows. LyteNyte Grid has three
  types of rows, group rows, aggregated rows, and leaf rows. These rows define the grid's main content.

## Row Node Interface

LyteNyte Grid represents rows using the `RowNode` interface. This interface is a union of three types:

- [`RowGroup`](/docs/reference/row#rowgroup): A row that contains child rows and establishes a hierarchical relationship.
- [`RowAggregated`](/docs/references/row#rowaggregate): A row that contains aggregate data but is not a group node that can be expanded.
- [`RowLeaf`](/docs/reference/row#rowleaf): A row with no child rows.

You can distinguish between row node types by checking the `kind` property. For example:

```ts
const row: RowNode = { ... };

const isLeaf = row.kind === "leaf";
const isGroup = row.kind === "branch";
const isAggregated = row.kind === "aggregated";
```

LyteNyte Grid also provides convenience methods for identifying row node types. When using
TypeScript, these methods will narrow the type of the `RowNode` union:

```ts
const isLeaf = api.rowIsLeaf(row);
const isGroup = api.rowIsGroup(row);
const isAggregated = api.rowIsAggregated(row);
```

## Row Indices

The **RowNode** interface intentionally omits a **row index** because a row node does not always
correspond to a rendered row. The grid's data source creates row nodes, and some
data sources, such as the [server data source](/docs/server-data-loading-overview), can return rows that are
not yet visible. These rows do not have a defined row index.

Although `RowNode` does not store a row index, LyteNyte Grid exposes the row index when it does exist.
The grid passes the `rowIndex` value to components and callbacks that operate on rendered rows.

Cell renderers, for example, receive a `rowIndex` prop, as shown in the row index demo below:

::demo[Row Indexing="../(column)/demos/column-marker"]

The marker column displays the row index for each rendered row.
The following cell renderer adds `1` to the index because LyteNyte Grid uses zero-based indexing:

```tsx
const cellRenderer = (p) => {
  return <div>{p.rowIndex + 1}</div>;
};
```
