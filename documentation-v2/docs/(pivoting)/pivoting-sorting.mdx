  descending order. Any pivot row may be sorted.

:::note

You should be familiar with how sorting works in the client data source before reading this
guide. The sort functionality for pivots works in identical fashion except sorts are applied
to pivot rows. See the [Client Row Sorting guide](/docs/client-source-row-sorting) for more
details.

## Sorting Pivots

To sort the pivot columns set `sort` property on the pivot model. The demo below demonstrates this
by allowing you to sort on any column by clicking the header of the column.

::demo[Pivot Sorting="./demos/pivot-sorting"]

Sorting pivot rows is identical to sorting normal grid rows. The only difference is the sort model
is applied to the pivot property of the client source. However, dimensions sorts are performed by
referencing a column. With pivots the columns are dynamically generated.

LyteNyte Grid generates IDs for pivot columns based on the pivot data. For example, the demo
above the ID of the **25-34** column will be `"25-34-->profit"`. The first part is the value of
cell in the **Age Group** column, and the second part is the id of the measure applied, in this
case the **Profit** column.

If you need predicable IDs, you can use the `pivotColumnProcessor` property on the client data source
to alter the column IDs before the pivot columns are returned.

You should only try to set the pivot sort values ahead of time if you have a
controlled view and requirement specific columns to be sorted ahead of time. If you are
attempting to persist pivot state, LyteNyte Grid offers a better approach. See the
[Pivot State Persistence guide] for details.
