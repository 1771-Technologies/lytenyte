This guide assumes familiarity with client sorting. Pivot sorting works the same way,
but applies sorts to the pivot model. See the [Client Row Sorting guide](/docs/client-source-row-sorting)
for details.

## Sorting Pivots

To sort pivot columns, set the `sort` property on the pivot model.
In the demo below, click a column header to sort by that pivot column.
The demo uses a measure that sums **Profit**.

::demo[Pivot Sorting="./demos/pivot-sorting"]

The demo applies the sort configuration to the pivot model state. As a result, rows are
sorted based on the generated pivot columns. If the pivot columns change, the sort is
removed because the sorted field no longer exists.

LyteNyte Grid generates IDs for pivot columns based on pivot data. For example, in the demo
above, the ID of the **25-34** column is `"25-34-->profit"`. The first segment represents the
cell value from the **Age Group** column, and the second segment represents the ID of the
applied measure, in this case **Profit**. Use this generated sort ID when defining a sort
function for pivoted rows.

If you need predictable column IDs, use the `pivotColumnProcessor` property on the client
data source to modify column IDs before the pivot columns are returned.
