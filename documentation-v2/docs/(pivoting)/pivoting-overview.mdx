title: Pivoting Overview
pro: true
description: LyteNyte's pivot functionality let's you create rotated views of your grid data, allowing
  you to see comparisons, patterns and trends in your data.

Pivoting allows you to take the cell values of a particular column and create dynamic columns out of the
columns. You can then apply measures that will summarize data of a different column allowing you to break
out the aggregation into the parts that contribute the pivot column.

:::note

The guides in this section will cover pivoting using the
[client row data source](/docs/client-source-overview). For server side pivoting see the
[Server Data Pivoting guide](/docs/server-data-loading-pivoting).

For the other row data sources, such as the [tree data source](/docs/tree-source-overview) and the
[paginated data source](/docs/paginated-rs-overview), pivoting is not supported, since it is not
possible to unambiguously pivot data for these sources.
