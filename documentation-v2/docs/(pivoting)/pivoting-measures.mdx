step: Aggregate and summarize row data when pivoting.
description: A measure is an aggregation dimension that can be used to summarize
  data when row and columns pivots are applied to the grid.
---

To create a measure, define a custom function that will receive an array of [leaf rows](/docs/row-overview)
and a [field value](/docs/column-field) and must return a summarized value. The summarized value can
be any type but it is normally a number.

You should be familiar with row aggregations before reading this guide. If you haven't already,
see the [Client Row Aggregations guide](/docs/client-source-aggregations) for more details.

## Measures

Define a measure by setting the `measure` property on the pivot model. A measure will be used
by LyteNyte Grid for two purposes:

1. Aggregate row data based on the row pivot and column pivot dimensions.
2. If the measure dimension is a column, it will be used as a reference for the
   columns created by the applied column pivot dimensions.

The demo below shows a measure that will aggregated the **Profit** column. The grid is
row pivoted on the **Country** column and column pivoted on the **Age Group** column.

The view can be understood as the profit breakdown per country, split out by age groups.

::demo[Profit Measure="./demos/pivot-measures"]

The code to apply the measure is shown below. This demo uses a predefined measure function called
`"sum"`, but you can provide a function directly inline if that works better for your application's
use case.

```ts
//!next 4
const aggSum: Grid.T.Aggregator<GridSpec["data"]> = (field, data) => {
  const values = data.map((x) => computeField<number>(field, x));
  return sum(values);
};

const ds = useClientDataSource<GridSpec>({
  data: salesData,
  pivotMode: true,
  pivotModel: {
    columns: [{ id: "ageGroup" }],
    rows: [{ id: "country" }],
    //!next 6
    measures: [
      {
        dim: { id: "profit", name: "Profit", type: "number", cellRenderer: ProfitCell, width: 120 },
        fn: "sum",
      },
    ],
  },
  aggregateFns: { sum: aggSum },
});
```

### Multiple Measures

You can apply multiple measures to the pivot configuration by providing more dimensions. The order of
measures applied to the grid does not matter, though the order will influence the initial column
order when pivots are applied.

The demo below demonstrates multiple measures in action. You can also update the measure function
by clicking the measure function name and selecting a new measure for that column.

Each measure results in the additional columns being created when pivots are presented. If a column
pivot results in 20 dynamic columns being created, then for each measure roughly 20 columns will be
added. If you have two measures, there will be 40 columns, 3 measures will have 60 columns, and so on.
