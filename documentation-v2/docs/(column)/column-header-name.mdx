title: Column ID & Name
step: Define user-friendly column names and ensure unique IDs.
description: Every column in LyteNyte Grid must have a unique ID. LyteNyte Grid
  uses this ID to manage column related state. When the ID is not human readable,
  you can provide a display name.

## Unique Column IDs

LyteNyte Grid uses the `id` of a column to uniquely identify and track the column.
The `id` is used for retrieval, detecting movement, and computing cell values.

Column IDs are immutable. If you change a column's `id` value, LyteNyte Grid
treats the column as a new column, even if the rest of the object is unchanged.

A column `id` can be any string that fits your data model.
Many developers set the `id` to a key on the row data. This is convenient
since LyteNyte Grid also uses the `id` as a fallback when a column
does not define a `field`. See the [Column Field guide](/docs/column-field) for details.

## Column Display Name

By default, LyteNyte Grid uses the column's `id` as its display name.
The display name appears in the column header and in components that manage
columns, such as the [Column Manager](/docs/component-column-manager).

If the `id` is not suitable for display, set the `name` property to a
human-readable string. In the example below, several columns specify
a `name` to improve their header text:

```ts
const columns: Grid.Column[] = [
  { id: "id", name: "ID" },
  { id: "product" },
  { id: "price" },
  { id: "customer" },
  { id: "purchaseDate", name: "Purchase Date" },
  { id: "paymentMethod", name: "Payment Method" },
  { id: "email" },
];
```

::demo[Human Readable Names="./demos/column-overview-demo"]

In this example, `purchaseDate`, `paymentMethod`, and `id` use `name` to
provide readable labels, while the remaining IDs are already clear. Developers often
set `name` when the `id` is written in snake case or camel case.

## Updating the Display Name

A column's `id` is immutable, but its `name` can be updated. To change the display
name, update the column specification. LyteNyte Grid provides the `columnUpdate` API
for updating individual columns.

For example, you may want users to rename columns. In the demo below, users can
double-click a header to edit the display name. Pressing Enter or
clicking away saves the new value.

::demo[Renaming Column Headers="./demos/column-header-name-update"]

To support header name editing, this example uses a custom header cell
and extends the grid API to edit header names.
For more guidance on extending the grid API,
see the [API Extension guide](/docs/grid-api-extension).
