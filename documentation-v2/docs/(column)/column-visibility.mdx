step: Control which columns are visible.
description: Learn how to manage column visibility in LyteNyte Grid and understand
  the difference between hidden columns and collapsed column groups.
---

LyteNyte Grid supports defining columns that are initially hidden.
Developers can toggle column visibility during runtime. The grid also supports
column groups, allowing related columns to be shown or hidden together.

## Hiding Columns

Each column in LyteNyte Grid has a `hide` property in its specification. This property defaults to `false`.
When set to `true`, the grid does not render the column in the viewport.
The grid still includes the column internally, and queries against
grid state will continue to return it.

In the demo below, the **Network** and **Exchange** columns start hidden.
Clicking their pills toggles each column's visibility.
When a hidden column becomes visible, the grid inserts it based on
its position in the column state.

::demo[Hiding Columns="./demos/column-visibility"]

The demo uses the Pill Manager provided by LyteNyte Grid. When a user clicks a pill,
the demo toggles that column's visibility. Since the demo updates the columns at runtime,
the demo stores the column definitions in React state. The Pill Manager is a versatile
component capable of managing column visibility, ordering, grouping, and more.
See the [Pill Manager guide](/docs/component-pill-manager) for more details.

Avoid updating a column's visibility too frequently. Each update triggers a layout recalculation and
DOM update, which can be expensive when performed many times per second.

## Column Group Visibility

A column group is a developer-defined collection of related columns.
A group may be collapsed, causing certain columns to appear only when the group is open.

When the grid collapses a group, it hides the affected columns visually.
However, this behavior differs from setting `hide` on a column specification.
The grid still considers these columns logically visible.
In other words, their visibility state remains `true` even though the
collapsed group hides them in the UI.

The example below demonstrates this behavior. The **Market Info** group is collapsed,
which hides the **Network** and **Exchange** columns. The Pill Manager still shows
them as visible because the grid treats them as visible in state,
even though the collapsed group hides them visually.

::demo[Column Group Visibility="./demos/column-visibility_groups"]

You may also notice that if you hide the **Symbol** column, or if you hide both the **Exchange**
and **Network** columns, the column group is no longer collapsible. You can collapse a column group
only if at least one column is visible when the group is open and at least one column is visible when
the group is closed. For more on column groups, see our [Column Groups guide].
