step: Control which columns are visible.
description: Learn how to manage column visibility in LyteNyte Grid and understand
  the difference between hidden columns and collapsed column groups.
---

LyteNyte Grid supports defining columns that are initially hidden.
Developers can toggle column visibility during runtime. The grid also supports
column groups, allowing related columns to be shown or hidden together.

## Hiding Columns

Each column in LyteNyte Grid has a `hide` property in its specification. This property defaults to `false`.
When set to `true`, the grid does not render the column in the viewport.
The grid still includes the column internally, and queries against
grid state will continue to return it.

In the demo below, the **Network** and **Exchange** columns start hidden.
Clicking their pills toggles each column's visibility.
When a hidden column becomes visible, the grid inserts it based on
its position in the column state.

The demo uses the Pill Manager provided by LyteNyte Grid. Clicking a pill toggles the visibility
of its corresponding column. Since columns are updated at runtime, their
column definitions are stored in React state.

The Pill Manager is a versatile component that manages column
visibility, ordering, grouping, and additional functions.
See the [Pill Manager guide](/docs/component-pill-manager) for more details.

:::warn

Avoid updating a column's visibility too frequently. Each update triggers a layout recalculation and
DOM update, which can be expensive when performed many times per second.

## Column Group Visibility

A column group is a developer-defined collection of related columns.
A group may be collapsed, causing certain columns to appear only when the group is open.

When the grid collapses a group, it hides the affected columns visually.
However, this behavior differs from setting `hide` on a column specification.
The grid still considers these columns logically visible.
In other words, their visibility state remains `true` even though the
collapsed group hides them in the UI.

The example below demonstrates this behavior. The **Market Info** group is collapsed,
which hides the **Network** and **Exchange** columns. The Pill Manager still shows
them as visible because the grid treats them as visible in state,
even though the collapsed group hides them visually.

::demo[Column Group Visibility="./demos/column-visibility_groups"]

:::note

Hiding the **Symbol** column or both the **Exchange** and **Network** columns makes the column
group no longer collapsible. A column group can be collapsed only if at
least one column is visible when the group is open and at least
one column is visible when it is closed.

For more on column groups, see our [Column Groups guide](/docs/column-groups).
