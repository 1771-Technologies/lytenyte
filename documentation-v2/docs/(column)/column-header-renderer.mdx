title: Column Header Renderer
description: Every column may define a unique header renderer to determine the
  content that should be displayed in the header cell.

A header renderer is a custom React component that LyteNyte Grid uses to render header cell content.
Use the `headerRenderer` property on the [column specification](/docs/reference)
to set the component.

## Header Renderers

Creating a header renderer involves the following steps:

1. Define a custom React component function that accepts an object of type `Grid.T.HeaderParams` as its props.
2. Set the value of the `headerRenderer` property for each column that should use this renderer.

The demo below shows this in action. Each column has a custom `headerRenderer` that adds an
icon based on the column ID.

The header renderer in the demo is a normal React component. LyteNyte Grid renders it within the same
React tree as the rest of your application. This means the renderer can access React
context and use any React hooks.
