title: Marker Column
description: The marker column is an auxiliary column created and managed by
  LyteNyte Grid. It is always pinned to the start of the viewport.
---

Use the marker column for information that does not come from the
row data or for interactive actions that do not fit
cleanly into other columns. Common use cases include:

- Displaying the current row index.
- Rendering a checkbox for row selection.

## Enabling Marker Column

To enable the marker column, add a `columnMarker` definition to the grid
and set its `on` property to `true`.

```ts
const marker: Grid.ColumnMarker<GridSpec> = {
  on: true, //!

  // Other marker column properties
};
```

The demo below shows the marker column displaying row indices.
The displayed index starts at `1`, while actual row indices in
LyteNyte Grid start at `0`.

::demo[Row Index Marker Column="./demos/column-marker"]

The marker column differs from standard columns and has important restrictions:

- It is always pinned to the start of the viewport.
- It cannot be moved or reordered.
- It is not part of the `columns` state but does affect column display order. When enabled,
  the marker column will always appear first, and display index `0` always refers to the marker column.

## Selection Marker Column

A common use case for the marker column is row selection.
The marker column can render a checkbox for each row. Because
this is so common, LyteNyte Grid provides the `api.rowHandleSelect`
method to simplify selection logic, including shift-select behavior.

::demo[Marker Column Selection="./demos/column-marker-selection"]

The demo uses `api.rowHandleSelect` to manage checkbox interactions:

```tsx
<GridCheckbox
  checked={selected}
  onClick={(ev) => {
    ev.stopPropagation();
    api.rowHandleSelect({ shiftKey: ev.shiftKey, target: ev.target }); //!
  }}
  onKeyDown={(ev) => {
    if (ev.key === "Enter" || ev.key === " ")
      api.rowHandleSelect({ shiftKey: ev.shiftKey, target: ev.target }); //!
  }}
/>
```
