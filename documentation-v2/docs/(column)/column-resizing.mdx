## Resizing Columns

Columns in LyteNyte Grid always have a fixed width. To resize a column, update
its fixed width. Users can drag the edge of a column header to change its width.
LyteNyte Grid supports this interaction out of the box. Enable it by setting
the `resizable` property to `true` on the column's `uiHints` property.
The example below enables resizing for all columns.

```ts
const grid = Grid.useLyteNyte({
  // ... other properties
  columnBase: {
    uiHints: {
      resizable: true,
    },
  },
});
```

When `resizable` is `true`, the grid renders a resize handle on the
header's edge. Users can drag this handle to change the width of a column.
The demo below enables the drag handle.
Try placing your cursor on the right edge of a column header
and dragging once the hover indicator appears.

Dragging to resize does not work on touch devices because touch dragging scrolls the viewport.
The developer should provide an alternative resize action, such as a “size to fit” button for accessibility purposes.

### Customizing the Resize Handle

LyteNyte Grid renders the resize handle as an invisible `div`. You can style it
using CSS or by passing properties to the `Grid.HeaderCell` component.
Three properties customize the resize handle:

- `resizeStyle`: Inline styles applied to the handle.
- `resizeClassName`: CSS class names applied to the handle.
- `resizeAs`: A render prop that supplies custom React content for the handle.

In most cases, `resizeClassName` is enough to customize the handle's appearance.

If you use a built-in grid theme, the handle already has styling. The
default themes use the following CSS, which you can reference when implementing your own
customizations:

```css
[data-ln-header-resizer="true"] {
  background-color: transparent;
  transition: background-color 200ms ease-in-out;
  cursor: col-resize;
  &:hover {
    background-color: var(--lng1771-primary-50);
  }
}
```

### Resizing Programmatically

For one-off resizes or custom resize workflows, call the grid API's `columnResize` method.
It accepts a JavaScript object mapping column IDs to widths.

```ts
grid.api.columnResize({ exchange: 200, network: 100 });
```

The `columnResize` method is a convenience wrapper around `columnUpdate`. The following
code produces the same result:

```ts
grid.api.columnUpdate({ exchange: { width: 200 }, network: { width: 100 } });
```

### Min & Max Column Width

Use the `widthMin` and `widthMax` properties to clamp a column's width.
By default, columns have a minimum width of `80px` and a maximum width of `1000px`.

The demo below clamps column widths between `100px` and `300px`.
When a user resizes a column past these bounds, LyteNyte Grid will use a clamped
width value for layout calculations.

!demo:Column Width Bounds="./demos/column-resizing-minmax_x"

The column `widthMin` and `widthMax` properties define visual layout bounds that
LyteNyte enforces. LyteNyte does not clamp the column's `width` value to
those limits, so your code can set `width` outside `widthMin`/`widthMax`. If `width` is out
of bounds and you later change `widthMin` or `widthMax`, LyteNyte immediately
resizes the column to fit the updated limits.

```ts
const column = { id: "exchange", widthMin: 100, width: 3000, widthMax: 300 };
```

## Column Width Flex

Every column has a specified width or a default width. When the total column width is
smaller than the viewport, you can allocate the remaining space using `widthFlex`.
This property defines how much of the free space a column should take,
similar to the CSS `flex` property.

!demo:Full Width Viewport Filling="./demos/column-resizing-width-flex_x"

<Callout>

`widthFlex` is most noticeable on wide viewports. On small screens, you may not see
columns expand. View this demo on a desktop-sized display to see the effect.

</Callout>

## Size To Fit

The `columnSizeToFit` property sizes columns so they fit within the viewport.
When total column width exceeds the viewport, the grid shrinks column widths.
When total width is smaller, the grid expands them.

In the demo below, you can toggle the `columnSizeToFit` property to observe how
it changes the widths of the column. The smaller the size of your display the
more pronounced the effect will be.

!demo:Size-to-Fit Columns="./demos/column-resizing-size-to-fit_x"

Use the `columnSizeToFit` property sparingly. Columns can appear compressed on
narrow viewports, and cell content may truncate. Only enable this feature
when all columns must be visible.

## Measure Text Function

LyteNyte Grid exports a `measureText` function that approximates the
pixel width of a string. This is useful when adjusting cell
content based on available space.

Measuring the width of a given cell's text, allows for some interesting use cases.
For example, applications like Excel show `#` symbols when a number overflows the cell.
The demo below demonstrates the pattern by toggling this effect on and off.

- **String Truncation:** The **Symbol** and **Exchange** columns, which contain strings, are truncated.
- **Number Hashing:** The **Performance** and **Volatility** columns, which contain numbers, are hashed.

!demo:Truncating and Hashing="./demos/column-resizing-measure-text_x"

In the demo, the `HashedValue` component uses `measureText` inside a `useMemo`
call. Measuring text is expensive, so caching the result avoids running the calculation on every render.

```tsx
function HashedValue({
  value,
  columnIndex,
  gridState,
}: {
  value: string;
  gridState: GridState<DEXPerformanceData>;
  columnIndex: number;
}) {
  const widths = gridState.xPositions.useValue();
  const width = widths[columnIndex + 1] - widths[columnIndex];

  const measuredWidth = useMemo(() => {
    const m = measureText(value, gridState.viewport.get()!);
    return m.width;
  }, [gridState.viewport, value]);

  if (measuredWidth > width) return "#".repeat(Math.ceil(width / 16) + 1);

  return value;
}
```

The `measureText` function has many uses. LyteNyte Grid relies on it internally for autosizing and
other text-based measurements. Remember that the function returns an approximation, not
an exact value. Differences in browser text rendering prevent pixel-perfect consistency.
