title: Column Header Height
step: Set the height of the column header and column group header.
description: LyteNyte Grid lets you customize header height flexibly. The header's total height
  comes from the combined height of column group headers, column headers, and floating headers.
---

Use the `headerHeight` property on the grid to set the height of the header row in pixels.
The demo below showcases this feature, including programmatic updates.

## Column Groups & Header Spanning

When column groups are enabled, some column headers may span across
multiple group rows, increasing the cell's header height since it
must bridge the missing group rows. This occurs when:

- A column does not belong to any group
- The columns group path is shallower than the deepest group level

In the demo below, **Price** and **Product** belong to the **Inventory** group.
All other columns are ungrouped, so their header cells span every group
row and reach the leaf row, giving them the full header height. A
header cell's height is the **leaf header (base) height**
plus the **combined height of the group rows it spans**.

If all group rows share height G, then header height is determined as follows:

```txt
finalHeaderHeight = baseHeaderHeight + (spannedGroupRowCount * G)
```

## Column Group Header Height

Set the height of group header rows using the `headerGroupHeight` property on the grid.
All column groups share the same group-header height.

## Floating Row Height

The floating row appears directly under the column header and is useful for supplemental UI,
such as floating filters. Set its height using the `floatingRowHeight` property.

The demo below shows a simple example that adds text-matching filters for string columns. For
more details, see the [Column Floating Header guide](/docs/column-floating-header).
