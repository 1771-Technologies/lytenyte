## Filtering Paginated Rows

To filter rows on the server, define a filter model and include it in each data request.
The filter model can be included in the `queryKey` of the `useServerDataSource` hook.
Whenever the filter model changes a new set of rows can be fetched from the server.

The following demo passes a custom filter model to the `queryKey` of the server data source. Click the
funnel icon in the column header to apply a filter.
