## Sorting Paginated Rows

To sort rows on the server, define a sort model and include it in each data request. The
`useServerDataSource` hook accepts the sort model as a member of the `queryKey`.

The sort model you define can take any shape that fits your application's needs, though the
most straightforward definition would match the model your server or data base uses.

The demo below demonstrates paginated row sorting. Clicking a column header updates that column's
sort state.

::demo[Sorted Paginated Rows="./demos/server-sorting"]

The demo code applies sort state to individual columns. By extends the [grid's API](/docs/grid-api-extensions)
you can update the `sort` property on the columns directly. The extended API is then able to apply different
sorts when a column header is clicked.
