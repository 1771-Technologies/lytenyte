## Sorting Paginated Rows

To sort rows on the server, define a sort model and include it in each data request. The
`useServerDataSource` hook accepts the sort model as part of the `queryKey`.

The sort model can take any shape that fits your application's needs. In most cases, you should
match the format that your server or database expects.

The demo below shows paginated row sorting. When you click a column header, the grid updates that column's
sort state.

::demo[Sorted Paginated Rows="./demos/server-sorting"]

The demo code applies sort state to individual columns. By extending the [grid's API](/docs/grid-api-extensions),
you can update the `sort` property on each column directly. The extended API then applies the appropriate
sort when the user clicks a column header.
