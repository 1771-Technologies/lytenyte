![V2 Release Grid](/v2-image.png)

LyteNyte Grid v2 improves on v1 in almost every aspect. The primary focus of this release is
the grid's developer experience. LyteNyte Grid is designed to fit your application,
not force your application to fit the grid.

v2 is smaller, faster, more lightweight, and more capable than v1.
It achieves these improvements in three key ways:

1. Removal of the `useLyteNyte` hook in favor of a completely prop-driven grid.
2. Introduction of [API and column extensions](/docs/grid-api-extensions).
3. A predefined [headless configuration](/docs/grid-headless-parts).

In addition, v2 includes many minor and quality-of-life improvements,
along with significant enhancements to existing features.

### New Grid Features

- Use the `cellSelectionExcludeMarker` grid property to prevent selection of the [marker column](/docs/marker-column).
- Use the `cellSelectionMaintainOnNonCellPosition` grid property to prevent clearing [cell selection](/docs/cell-selection) when focus moves to a non-grid element.
- The `columnMoveDragPlaceholder` and `columnGroupMoveDragPlaceholder` properties allow you to specify a custom drag indicator when [moving columns or column groups](/docs/column-moving).
- The `columnGroupRenderer` property allows you to provide a custom React component to render [column groups](/docs/column-groups).
- Use the `events` property to define event handlers for any standard HTML event on any part of the grid, such as cells,
  rows, or headers. Event handlers receive additional contextual information.
- Use the `styles` property to apply inline styles and classes to grid elements.
- Use the `rowAlternateAttr` property to disable the row-alternating data attribute.
- Use the `rowDropAccept` property to allow rows from other grids to be dragged into the current grid.
- Use the `ref` property to obtain a reference to the grid API.
- Use the `slotShadows` property to render the new [Viewport Shadows component](/docs/component-viewport-shadows).
- Use the `slotViewportOverlay` and `slotRowsOverlay` properties to render custom [overlay components](/docs/component-grid-overlays).
- `editMode` now supports [full row editing](/docs/cell-editing-full-row).
- The `onColumnMoveOutside` event detects when a column is dragged outside the grid.
- [Pivot mode](/docs/pivoting-overview) now supports a **Grand Totals** row.
- Pivot columns can now be processed and alternated before the grid renders them.
- Column Groups can now be used to resize all columns under the group if the child columns are resizable.
- The `pivotModel` now supports label filtering.
- You can now apply [label filters](/docs/client-source-label-filters) to the client row source.
- You can now apply [having filters](/docs/client-source-having-filters) (post-grouping filters) to the client row source.
- All grid row sources now directly support adding and deleting rows.
- Client row groups can now be flattened when a group has a single leaf child.
- Row selection now supports two modes:
  1. [Isolated row selection](/docs/row-selection#isolated-row-selection), where each row maintains its own selection state.
  2. [Linked row selection](/docs/row-selection#linked-row-selection), where a row group's selection state links to the selection state of its children.
- You can now exclude individual rows from the set of selectable rows.
- The client row source can now suppress automatic expansion to the leaf row.
- The client row source now supports unbalanced row groups with varying levels of depth. This capability replaces the existing tree data source and satisfies both use cases.
- The [tree data source](/docs/tree-source-data) now accepts object-based data instead of array-based data.
  - Render arbitrary objects.
  - Edit object data.
  - Build advanced tree views.
- New components and utilities:
  - A headless [`SelectAll`](/docs/component-select-all) component for selecting or deselecting all rows.
  - A [`RowGroupCell`](/docs/component-row-group-cell) component for managing row group expansion.
  - A simple [`TreeView`](/docs/component-tree-view) component that renders a specially configured version of LyteNyte Grid.
  - A [`SmartSelect`](/docs/component-smart-select) component that you can use as a custom dropdown, combobox, or multi-combobox.
  - A [`Dialog`](/docs/component-dialog) component for grid-specific dialogs or general application dialogs.
  - A [`Popover`](/docs/component-popover) component for grid features or general popover usage.
  - A [`Menu`](/docs/component-menu-button) component for general-purpose dropdown menus.

### Grid Property Changes

- The `cellSelectionExcludeMarker` property has been added. This property prevents [marker column selection](/docs/cell-selection).
- The `onCellSelectionChange` property has been added. This property handles [cell selection](/docs/cell-selection) updates.
- The `colScanDistance` property has been removed. The grid now determines the appropriate scan distance automatically.
- The `rowFullWidthPredicate` and `rowFullWidthRenderer` parameters now receive the grid API instead of the grid state object.
- The `sortModel`, `filterModel`, `filterInModel`, `rowGroupModel`, and `aggModel` properties have been removed. These models now
  live on the grid's row data sources. You can now define custom models.
- The `rowGroupColumn` property now accepts `false` to disable it. The `rowGroupDisplayMode` property has been removed.
- The `rowGroupDefaultExpansion` and `rowGroupExpansion` properties now live on the row data source.
- The `cellRenderers`, `floatingCellRenderers`, `headerCellRenderers`, and `editRenderers` properties have been removed. These properties are no longer required.
- `rowSelectionActivator` now uses `"single-click"` instead of `"single"`.
- The `rowDetailRenderer` now receives the grid API instead of the grid state object.
- The `editCellMode` property has been renamed to `editMode`.
- The `editRowValidatorFn` now receives the updated edit parameters.
- The `columnMarkerEnabled` property has been removed. Enable the marker column through the [marker column definition](/docs/marker-column).
- The `rowDataSource` property has been renamed to `rowSource`.
- The `rowSelectedIds` property has been removed. The row data source now manages row selection.
- The `rowSelectChildren` property has been removed. Use [linked row selection](/docs/row-selection) instead.
- The `quickSearch` and `quickSearchSensitivity` properties have been removed. Define quick search at the row source level.
- The `columnPivotMode` and `columnPivotModel` properties have been removed. Handle column pivoting at the row source level.
- The `dialogFrames` and `popoverFrames` properties have been removed. You can now trigger dialogs and popovers without these properties.

### Column Property Changes

- The `headerRenderer`, `cellRenderer`, `floatingCellRenderer`, and `editRenderer` properties no longer accept a `string` value for a
  pre-registered renderer. Resolve the renderer before providing the column definitions to the grid.
- The `quickSearchIgnore` property has been removed. Quick search is now opt-in.
- The `uiHints` property has been removed. Column extensions now replace this functionality.
- The `resizable` property has been added. It indicates whether the column can be [resized](/docs/column-resizing).
- The `movable` property has been added. It indicates whether the column can be [moved](/docs/column-moving).
- The `editOnPrintable` property has been added. It determines whether a [cell edit](/docs/cell-editing) begins when a printable character is pressed.
- The `editMutateCommit` property has been added. This callback function [mutates edit data](/docs/cell-editing) before the grid updates the row.

All function parameter types on the `Column` type now reflect the updated grid API and Column extension system introduced in v2.

- The `colSpan` and `rowSpan` functions now receive `api`, `column`, `row`, `rowIndex`, and `colIndex`. The `grid` parameter has been removed.
- The `field` function now receives `row` data to compute the value. The `grid`, `column`, and `data` parameters have
  been removed. These parameters are not required in v2 and are not available in every execution context.
- The `headerRenderer` function now receives `api` and `column`. The `grid` parameter has been removed.
- The `cellRenderer` function now receives `api`, `column`, `rowIndex`, `colIndex`, `selected`, `indeterminate`, `detailExpanded`,
  `editData`, and `layout`. The `grid`, `rowSelected`, `rowPin`, and `rowIndeterminate` parameters have been removed.
- The `editRenderer` function now receives `api`, `row`, `column`, `rowIndex`, `colIndex`, `editValue`, `changeValue`,
  `editData`, `editValidation`, `changeData`, `commit`, `cancel`, and `layout`. The `grid` parameter has been removed.
- The `editable` function now receives `api` instead of `grid`.
- The `editSetter` parameters have been reworked to provide data change types and the grid API instead of the grid state object.

### API Property Changes

- The `cellSelection` method has been added to retrieve the current grid selection state.
- The `xPosition$` and `yPosition$` properties have been added to provide reactive access to the grid's coordinate positions.
- The `viewport$` property has been added to provide reactive access to the grid's viewport state.
- The `columnView` method has been added to retrieve a description of the currently visible columns.
- The `rowDetailIsExpanded` property has been renamed to `rowDetailExpanded`.
- The `rowDetailRenderedHeight` property has been renamed to `rowDetailHeight`.
- The `rowIsAggregated` method has been added to determine whether a row is aggregated.
- The `rowGroupIsExpanded` method has been renamed to `rowIsExpanded`.
- The `rowIsExpandable` method has been added to determine whether a row can be expanded.
- The `rowView` method has been added to retrieve a description of the current row view.
- The `exportDataRect` method has been renamed to `exportData`.
- The `editUpdate` method has been split into two focused methods: `editUpdateRows` and `editUpdateCell`.
- The `useRowDrag` hook now provides streamlined drag parameters.
- The `columnIndex` method has been removed. Use the `columnView` method instead.
- The `sortForColumn` method has been removed. A column’s sort index now derives from the defined sort model.
- The `rowGroupColumnIndex` method has been removed. The grid now creates only a single row group column.
- The `rowGroupApplyExpansions` method has been removed. The grid no longer requires this method.
- The `eventAddListeners`, `eventRemoveListener`, and `eventFire` methods have been removed. LyteNyte Grid no longer maintains a custom event system.
- The `exportCsv` and `exportCsvFile` methods have been removed. Use the more flexible `exportData` method instead.
- The `dialogFrameOpen`, `dialogFrameClose`, `popoverFrameOpen`, and `popoverFrameClose` methods have been removed. The grid no longer manages dialog or popover state.
- The `rowSelect` method can now select all rows. The `rowSelectAll` method has been removed.

LyteNyte Grid now extends the Grid API with additional methods and properties based on the provided row source.
The following properties from v1 have changed or are now supplied by the row source:

- `rowById` is now provided by the row source.
- `rowByIndex` is now provided by the row source.

### Client Row Source Changes

The `useClientRowDataSource` hook has been [renamed to `useClientDataSource`](/docs/client-source-overview). The
`useClientRowDataSourcePaginated` hook has been removed. You can use `useClientDataSource`
for paginated client data, but this approach is not recommended. When all data exists
on the client, pagination introduces unnecessary complexity and is generally an anti-pattern.

The `useClientDataSource` hook now treats the row source as a derived value based on
the provided properties. As a result, the hook behaves like `useMemo` rather than `useState`.

- `bottomData` has been renamed to `botData`.
- `reflectData` has been removed. This property is no longer required.
- `rowIdLeaf` has been renamed to `leafIdFn`.
- `rowIdBranch` has been renamed to `groupIdFn`.
- `transformInFilterItem` has been removed. The client source no longer owns the data, and
  filter items can now be derived directly from the data.

The client row source is now responsible for:

- Column pivoting and pivot mode.
- Managing row group expansion state.
- Sorting, filtering, and aggregating row nodes.
- Managing row selection state.
- Creating, updating, and deleting rows.

In v1, the grid managed these responsibilities and indirectly delegated them to the client
source. This design required the grid to initialize before you could safely use client source state.

In v2, the grid removes this indirection. The client source is immediately usable,
regardless of whether the grid has mounted.

### Server Row Source Changes

The `useServerDataSource` hook is more capable in v2 while maintaining the same level of simplicity as v1.

- `dataFetcher` has been renamed to `queryFn`. The grid no longer passes built-in data models to
  this function. You can now define and manage your own custom models.
- `dataFetchExternals` has been renamed to `queryKey`. The `queryKey` property is now strongly typed through a generic parameter.
- `dataColumnPivotFetcher` has been removed. Fetch pivot columns directly inside your query handler.
- `dataInFilterItemFetcher` has been removed. Fetch filter items directly inside your query handler.
- `cellUpdate` has been renamed to `onRowDataChange` to keep prop names consistent across row data sources.
- `cellUpdateOptimistically` has been renamed to `rowUpdateOptimistically`.

The server data source now also manages:

- Row group expansion state.
- Row selection state.

The server data source can now:

- Delete rows.
- Add rows.

### Tree Row Source Changes

The tree data source from v1 has been removed. Use the client data source as a replacement.

v2 introduces a new, more advanced tree data source designed specifically for object-based data.
Because this implementation is entirely new, there is no direct migration path
or property mapping from v1.

See the [Tree Overview guide](/docs/tree-source-overview) for more details.

### Components Changes

The `SortManager` and `ListBox` components have been removed. You can recreate their
functionality using the new components provided by LyteNyte Grid.

The [`PillManager`](/docs/component-pill-manager) component replaces the `ListBox` component.
`PillManager` supports reordering and activating pill items.

The [`ColumnManager`](/docs/component-column-manager) component has been simplified and is now more
opinionated in its behavior. You can use it as a drop-in column manager. For more flexible and configurable tree
structures, use the new [TreeView component](/docs/component-tree-view) available in LyteNyte Grid.

### Theme Token Changes

LyteNyte Grid v2 introduces more clearly defined theme tokens while preserving the existing
color palette. The theme CSS is now split into separate files.

See the [Grid Theming guide](/docs/grid-theming) for more details.

### Migration from v1.x

This section provides a high-level overview of migrating from v1 to v2 of LyteNyte Grid.
If you have questions, open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/1771-Technologies/lytenyte/issues).

There are two primary changes required to migrate to v2:

<Steps>

1. Render the default grid instead of composing the grid from headless parts.

   Replace this v1 code:

   ```tsx
   <Grid.Root grid={grid}>
     <Grid.Viewport>
       <Grid.Header>
         {view.header.layout.map((row, i) => {
           return (
             <Grid.HeaderRow key={i} headerRowIndex={i}>
               {row.map((c) => {
                 if (c.kind === "group") return null;

                 return <Grid.HeaderCell key={c.id} cell={c} />;
               })}
             </Grid.HeaderRow>
           );
         })}
       </Grid.Header>
       <Grid.RowsContainer>
         <Grid.RowsCenter>
           {view.rows.center.map((row) => {
             if (row.kind === "full-width") return null;

             return (
               <Grid.Row row={row} key={row.id}>
                 {row.cells.map((c) => {
                   return <Grid.Cell key={c.id} cell={c} />;
                 })}
               </Grid.Row>
             );
           })}
         </Grid.RowsCenter>
       </Grid.RowsContainer>
     </Grid.Viewport>
   </Grid.Root>
   ```

   With this v2 code:

   ```tsx
   <Grid />
   ```

   If you need access to the internal grid parts, see the [Headless Component Parts guide](/docs/grid-headless-parts).

   :::note
   If your only customizations involved attaching event listeners or applying styles, set the `styles` and `events` props
   on the `Grid` component instead of breaking the grid into headless parts.
   :::

2. Remove the `useLyteNyte` hook (and the corresponding call to `useView`). Pass props directly to the `Grid` component.

   Instead of:

   ```tsx
   const grid = Grid.useLyteNyte({
     gridId: useId(),
     rowDataSource: ds,
     columns,
     editCellMode: "cell",
     columnBase: {
       editable: true,
       widthFlex: 1,
     },
   });
   ```

   Use:

   ```tsx
   <Grid rowSource={ds} editMode="cell" columnBase={{ editable: true, widthFlex: 1 }} />
   ```

   The `gridId` property is no longer required.

</Steps>

The steps above cover the primary migration changes. Review the changelog for property
renames and removals. TypeScript should surface most required updates.

#### Remove Effect Code

v2 is fully prop-driven. Remove any synchronization logic that mutates grid state through `useEffect`.

For example:

```tsx
const rowHeightParam = useRowHeightParam();

const grid = useLyteNyte({ rowHeight: rowHeightParam });

useEffect(() => {
  grid.state.rowHeight.set(rowHeightParam);
}, [grid, rowHeightParam]);

return <Grid.Root grid={grid}>{/* ... */}</Grid.Root>;
```

Replace it with:

```tsx
const rowHeightParam = useRowHeightParam();

return <Grid rowHeight={rowHeightParam} />;
```

#### Replacing the Predefined Models

In v1, LyteNyte Grid predefined filter, sort, and group models. In v2, your code defines these models dynamically.

See the following guides for the updated approach:

- [Filtering](/docs/client-source-filtering)
- [Sorting](/docs/client-source-row-sorting)
- [Row Grouping](/docs/client-source-row-grouping)
