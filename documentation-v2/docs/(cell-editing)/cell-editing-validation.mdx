title: Cell Edit Validation
step: Validate cell edits to ensure updates are correct.
description: Validating cell edits is an essential part of ensuring the integrity
  of the data in LyteNyte Grid when cell editing is enabled.
---

Ensuring cell values are correct, and providing clear error messages for invalid data,
is critical to creating a good user experience.

:::note

This guide assumes you are already familiar with the cell editing capabilities of LyteNyte Grid. Before
reading the rest of this guide, ensure you are familiar with the contents of the [Cell Editing guide](/docs/cell-editing)
and the [Cell Edit Renderers guide](/docs/cell-editing-renderers).

## Edit Validation

Set the `editRowValidatorFn` property on the grid to validate cell edit updates. LyteNyte Grid
uses the `editRowValidatorFn` function to validate edits at the row level, even when the user
edits only a single cell. The provided `editRowValidatorFn` function must return one of the
following values:

- `true`: Indicates the validation passed and the edit can safely be applied to the row data.
- `false`: Indicates the validation failed, but no additional information is provided. Only return
  `false` if you have another way to display validation feedback to the user.
- An object of type `Record<string, unknown>`, where the key is an arbitrary error code (of your choosing)
  and the value is an error message or error object.

In the demo below, an `editRowValidatorFn` function validates that the value in the **Price**
column is greater than 0. Double-click any cell in the **Price** column to begin editing. When
the value is less than or equal to 0, LyteNyte Grid displays an error tooltip.

::demo[Edit Validation="./demos/cell-editing-edit-validation"]

The demo code validates the **Price** column using the code shown below. You can
use `editRowValidatorFn` to validate any type of data and integrate any validation library.

```tsx
<Grid
  rowHeight={50}
  columns={columns}
  rowSource={ds}
  slotShadows={ViewportShadows}
  editMode="cell"
  //!next 10
  editRowValidatorFn={useCallback<Required<Grid.Props<GridSpec>>["editRowValidatorFn"]>((p) => {
    if (typeof p.editData !== "object") return false;

    const data = p.editData as Record<string, number>;
    if (data.price <= 0) {
      return { price: "Price must be greater than 0." };
    }

    return true;
  }, [])}
/>
```

:::tip

[Zod](https://zod.dev/) is a TypeScript-first schema validation library that has grown in popularity.
Consider using Zod to validate cell edits, which also provides strong type safety.
