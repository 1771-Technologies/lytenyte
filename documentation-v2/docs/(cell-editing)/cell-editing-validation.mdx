title: Cell Edit Validation
step: Validate cell edits to ensure updates are correct.
description: Validating cell edit is an essential part of ensuring the integrity
  of the data in LyteNyte Grid when cell editing is enabled.

Ensuring cell values are correct, and that understandable error messages are provided
for invalid data is critical to creating a good user experience.

:::note

This guide assumes you are already familiar with the cell editing capabilities of LyteNyte Grid. Before
reading the rest of this guide, ensure you are familiar with the contents of the [Cell Editing guide](/docs/cell-editing)
and [Cell Edit Renderers guide](/docs/cell-editing-renderers).

## Edit Validation

Set the `editRowValidatorFn` property on the grid to validate cell edit updates. The `editRowValidatorFn`
property is used to validate edits for the whole row, even if only a single cell is being edited. The
provided `editRowValidatorFn` function must return one of three values:

- `true`: Indicates the validation passed and the edit can safely be applied to the row data.
- `false`: Indicates the validation failed but no further information will be provided. Only return false
  if you have some other way of displaying validation failure feedback to the user.
- An object of the type `Record<string, unknown>`, where the key is an arbitrary error code (of your choosing)
  and the value is any error (and potentially an exception).

In the demo below a `editRowValidatorFn` function is provided to the grid, which will validate that the
value of the cell in the **Price** column is greater than 0. Double click any cell in the **Price** column
to begin editing. When the value is less than 0, a tooltip with the error will be displayed.

### Validation With Zod

The [Zod library](https://zod.dev/) is an open source TypeScript validation library. You can
use Zod in your `editRowValidatorFn` function to ensure row edits are valid. Zod is particularly
useful for ensuring type safety of your validation functions.

The demo below demonstrates how to use Zod to validate the edits to the cells in the **Price** column.
