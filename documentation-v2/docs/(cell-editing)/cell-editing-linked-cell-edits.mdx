title: Linked Cell Edits
step: Learn how to handle linked cells when editing data.
description: LyteNyte Grid edits cells on a cell by cell basis, however, the edit data is applied to the whole
  row. This makes it possible to link two or more cells, such that updating one cell's value results in the
  other cells being updated as well.

:::note

This guide assumes you are already familiar with the cell editing capabilities of LyteNyte Grid. Before
reading the rest of this guide, ensure you are familiar with the contents of the [Cell Editing guide](/docs/cell-editing)
and [Cell Edit Renderers guide](/docs/cell-editing-renderers).

## Editing More Than One Cell

A normal edit renderer will call the `changeValue` method on the [`EditParams`](/docs/reference) provided to the
edit renderer. The `changeValue` method updates the edit value for the current cell being edited. To create a
linked cell edit, use the `changeData` method instead, and provide a new edit value for all the cells whose
value should be updated when the current cell being edited is changed.

In the demo below the **Produce** column is linked to the price column. Any changes to the value of a cell
in the **Product** column will result in the value of the **Price** column being reset to match a predetermine
price for the new product.

Linked cell edits do not have to be connected in both directions. Changing the value of a cell in the
**Produce** column resets the **Price** cell's value, but changes to the **Price** cell do not impact the
selected product.

:::tip

A cell edit does not have to update another editable cell. This means you can create linked edits even for
cells that are not editable.
