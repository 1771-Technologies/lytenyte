title: Linked Cell Edits
step: Update dependent cells and cascade changes during edits.
description: LyteNyte Grid handles edits on a cell-by-cell basis but applies changes to the
  entire row. This allows you to link cells so that updating one
  value automatically updates others within the same row.

This guide builds on the concepts covered in the [Cell Editing](/docs/cell-editing) and
[Cell Edit Renderers](/docs/cell-editing-renderers) documentation.
We recommend reviewing those topics before proceeding.

## Editing Linked Cells

A standard edit renderer calls the `changeValue` method on the [`EditParams`](/docs/reference/grid-types#editing) passed to the
renderer. The `changeValue` method updates only the edit value for the cell currently being edited. To create
a linked cell edit, use the `changeData` method instead, and provide new edit values for all cells that should
update when the edited cell changes.

In the demo below, the **Product** column is linked to the **Price** column.
Selecting a new product automatically updates the **Price** to
that product's default value.

Linked edits don't have to be bidirectional.
Editing **Product** updates **Price**, but editing **Price** does
not change the selected product.

:::tip

A cell edit does not have to update another **editable** cell. You can create linked edits that update cells
which are not themselves editable.
