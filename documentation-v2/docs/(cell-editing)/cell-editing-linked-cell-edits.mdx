title: Linked Cell Edits
step: Learn how to handle linked cells when editing data.
description:
  LyteNyte Grid edits cells on a cell-by-cell basis. However, the edit data is applied to the entire
  row. This behavior makes it possible to link two or more cells, so that updating one cell also updates
  other cells in the same row.

:::note

This guide assumes you are already familiar with the cell editing capabilities of LyteNyte Grid. Before
reading the rest of this guide, ensure you are familiar with the contents of the [Cell Editing guide](/docs/cell-editing)
and the [Cell Edit Renderers guide](/docs/cell-editing-renderers).

## Editing More Than One Cell

A standard edit renderer calls the `changeValue` method on the [`EditParams`](/docs/reference) passed to the
renderer. The `changeValue` method updates only the edit value for the cell currently being edited. To create
a linked cell edit, use the `changeData` method instead, and provide new edit values for all cells that should
update when the edited cell changes.

In the demo below, the **Product** column is linked to the **Price** column. Any change to a cell in the
**Product** column resets the value of the **Price** column to a predetermined price for the selected product.

Linked cell edits do not have to be bidirectional. Changing the value of a cell in the **Product** column
resets the **Price** cell's value, but changes to the **Price** cell do not affect the selected product.

:::tip

A cell edit does not have to update another **editable** cell. You can create linked edits that update cells
which are not themselves editable.
