title: Full Row Cell Editing
step: Change the data in cells on a row by row basis.
description: LyteNyte Grid can edit all or some of the cells of a given row at the same time.
  When cells are edited as a row, the changes are applied and committed as a single row edit.

## Full Row Edits

Set the `editMode` property to `"row"` to enable cell editing in row mode. When cell editing is in row
mode, cells are updated on a row by row basis. When the cell edit begins, all the editable cells in the
row being edited will be rendered.

The demo below demonstrates row edit mode. The **Price**, **Customer**, and **Email** columns are all editable.
By double clicking a cell in these columns editing will begin and the cells will render their edit components.

Whilst in row edit mode and with an edit active, the Tab key will cycle through the cells of the row. LyteNyte
Grid does this to allow tab navigation of the editable cells in the row. Without row edit mode active, the tab
key would end the edit once the edit renderer loses focus.

### Row Edit vs Cell Edit

The choice of whether to use normal cell edits or full row edits depends mostly on the sort of data you
will be editing. Row editing shines when editing one cell often requires editing another cell in the same
row. Individual cell editing is better for general updates, since each cell's change is individually validated
and committed.

There is no performance penalty, or restriction when using row edits over cell edits. The choice is fully
use case dependent.
