## Full Row Edits

Set the `editMode` property to `"row"` to enable row-based cell editing. When row edit mode is active,
LyteNyte Grid updates cells on a per-row basis. When a row edit begins, the grid renders all editable
cells in the row.

The demo below shows row edit mode. The **Price**, **Customer**, and **Email** columns are editable.
Double-clicking a cell initiates row editing and renders edit components for all editable cells in that row.

When a row edit is active, pressing the Tab key cycles through the row's
editable cells. If row edit mode is not active, pressing Tab ends the edit when
the edit renderer loses focus.

### Row Edit vs Cell Edit

The choice between individual cell edits and full row edits depends largely on the type of data you are
editing. Row editing works best when editing one cell often requires editing another cell in the same row.
Individual cell editing is better for general updates, since each cell change is validated and committed
independently.

Using row edits instead of cell edits has no performance penalty or functional restrictions. The choice
depends entirely on your use case.
