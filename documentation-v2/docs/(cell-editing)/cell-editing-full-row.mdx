title: Full Row Cell Editing
step: Simultaneously edit cells across an entire row.
description: LyteNyte Grid can edit all or some of the cells in a given row at the same time.
  When cells are edited as a row, LyteNyte Grid applies and commits the changes as a single row edit.

## Full Row Edits

Set the `editMode` property to `"row"` to enable row-based cell editing. When row edit mode is active,
LyteNyte Grid updates cells on a per-row basis. When a row edit begins, the grid renders all editable
cells in the row.

The demo below demonstrates row edit mode. The **Price**, **Customer**, and **Email** columns are editable.
By double-clicking a cell in one of these columns, editing begins and the cells render their edit components.

::demo[Row Edit Mode="./demos/cell-editing-row"]

While a row edit is active, pressing the Tab key cycles through the editable cells in the row. LyteNyte
Grid enables this behavior to support tab-based navigation within the row. Without row edit mode active,
pressing Tab ends the edit when the edit renderer loses focus.

### Row Edit vs Cell Edit

The choice between individual cell edits and full row edits depends largely on the type of data you are
editing. Row editing works best when editing one cell often requires editing another cell in the same row.
Individual cell editing is better for general updates, since each cell change is validated and committed
independently.

Using row edits instead of cell edits has no performance penalty or functional restrictions. The choice
depends entirely on your use case.
