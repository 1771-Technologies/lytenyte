title: Bulk Cell Editing
step: Edit a group of cells in bulk.
description: LyteNyte Grid can edit cells in bulk through the grid's API. Provide
  updated data for specific rows, and LyteNyte Grid will update the rows in the grid
  as though the cells were edited.

:::note

Bulk updates are an advanced cell editing feature. Ensure you are familiar with the
cell editing functionality available in LyteNyte Grid. Read the [Cell Editing guide](/docs/cell-editing)
for more details.

## Edit Update Method

You can edit cells in bulk using the `editUpdate` method on the grid's API. The
`editUpdate` method requires a map of rows to update. The update map can use
two key types:

- `number`: Represents the row index of the row that should be updated.
- `string`: Represents the row ID of the row that should be updated.

When you provide a `number` key, LyteNyte Grid resolves the row index to its
row ID. Avoid setting both the row index and row ID for the same row in the map.

The demo below uses the `editUpdate` method to update the **Price** column in
bulk.

::demo[Bulk Cell Editing="./demos/cell-editing-bulk"]

The two buttons, **Increase Price** and **Decrease Price**, both leverage the grid's API
to create a bulk update that increases or decreases the price of every row by 10, respectively.
The code is shown below for increasing the price. Notice that the code creates a new update map,
then calls `editUpdate` to update the rows through LyteNyte Grid's edit functionality.

```tsx
<button
  //!next 9
  onClick={() => {
    const update = new Map(
      data.map((x, i) => {
        return [i, { ...x, price: x.price + 10 }];
      }),
    );

    apiRef.current?.editUpdate(update);
  }}
>
  Increase Price (+10)
  <ArrowUpIcon />
</button>
```

### Bulk Update vs. Direct Row Update

At first glance, the `editUpdate` method appears to do the same thing as updating
the rows in the grid directly. However, there is a distinction. When you update rows through
`editUpdate`, LyteNyte Grid runs the same validations as if the user edited the cell directly.

All rows must pass validation for LyteNyte Grid to apply the bulk update. The `editUpdate`
method returns the row validation result, which you can use to provide feedback
if the update fails.
