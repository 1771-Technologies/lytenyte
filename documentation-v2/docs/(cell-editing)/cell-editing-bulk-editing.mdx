title: Bulk Cell Editing
step: Programmatically update large datasets via the API.
description: Use the LyteNyte Grid API to perform bulk cell updates. Provide updated data
  for targeted rows, and the grid will update the corresponding
  cells as if they were edited directly.

:::note

Bulk updates require familiarity with cell editing. See the [Cell Editing guide](/docs/cell-editing) for more details.

## Edit Update Method

You can edit cells in bulk using the [`editUpdateRows`](/docs/reference/grid-api#cell-editing) method on the grid's API. The
`editUpdateRows` method requires a map of rows to update. The update map can use
two key types:

- `number`: Represents the row index of the row that should be updated.
- `string`: Represents the row ID of the row that should be updated.

When you provide a `number` key, LyteNyte Grid resolves the row index to its
row ID. Avoid setting both the row index and row ID for the same row in the map.

The demo below uses the `editUpdateRows` method to update the **Price** column in
bulk.

::demo[Bulk Cell Editing="./demos/cell-editing-bulk"]

The code for increasing the price is shown below. Notice that the code creates a new update map,
then calls `editUpdateRows` to update the rows through LyteNyte Grid's edit functionality.

```tsx
<button
  //!next 9
  onClick={() => {
    const update = new Map(
      data.map((x, i) => {
        return [i, { ...x, price: x.price + 10 }];
      }),
    );

    apiRef.current?.editUpdate(update);
  }}
>
  Increase Price (+10)
  <ArrowUpIcon />
</button>
```

### Bulk Update vs. Direct Row Update

At first glance, the `editUpdateRows` method appears to do the same thing as updating
the rows in the grid directly. However, there is a distinction. When you update rows through
`editUpdateRows`, LyteNyte Grid runs the same validations as if the user edited the cell directly.

All rows must pass validation for LyteNyte Grid to apply the bulk update. The `editUpdateRows`
method returns the row validation result, which you can use to provide feedback
if the update fails.

## Bulk Editing Cells

You can use the [`editUpdateCells`](/docs/reference/grid-api#cell-editing) method to bulk update a set of cells in
the grid, rather than updating entire rows. The `editUpdateCells` method is a convenience
wrapper that uses `editUpdateRows` internally. LyteNyte Grid converts the provided cell
updates into row updates and then calls `editUpdateRows`.

The demo below demonstrates `editUpdateCells` by implementing standard clipboard
functionality, including copy, cut, and paste. See the
[Clipboard guide](/docs/export-clipboard) for more details.

Select a range of cells and press **Control-C** to copy them,
or **Control-X** to cut them. Press **Control-V** to paste the cells into the grid.
The demo grid does not validate pasted cell values. See the
[Cell Editing Validation guide](/docs/cell-editing-validation) for details on how
to validate cell edits.

::demo[Edit Cells In Bulk="../(export)/demos/clipboard"]

:::note

The clipboard demo uses [cell range selection](/docs/cell-selection), which is a <ProTag /> feature. However,
the `editUpdateCells` method is available in the Core edition of LyteNyte Grid.
