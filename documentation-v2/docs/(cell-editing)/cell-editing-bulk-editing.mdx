cell editing functionality available in LyteNyte Grid. Read the [Cell Editing guide](/docs/cell-editing)
for more details.

## Edit Update Method

Cells can be edited in bulk using the `editUpdate` method on the grid's API. The
`editUpdate` method must be provided a map of rows to update. The map provided may
have keys of two types:

- `number`: Represents the row index of the row that should be updated.
- `string`: Represents the row id of the row that should be updated.

When providing a `number` key, LyteNyte Grid will resolve the row index to its
row ID. avoid setting both the row index and row ID for the same row in the map.

The demo below uses teh `editUpdate` method to randomly update rows in bulk.
The demo shows the basic functionality.

### Bulk Update Vs Direct Row Update

At first glance the `editUpdate` method appears to do the same thing as just updating
the rows in the grid directly, however, there is a distinction. When updating rows through
the `editUpdate` function LyteNyte Grid will call the necessary validations for the edits
as though the user edited the cell directly.

All the rows must pass the validation for the bulk update to be applied. The `editUpdate`
function returns the result of the row validation, which you can use to provide feedback
if the update fails.
