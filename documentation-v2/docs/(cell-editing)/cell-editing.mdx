step: Edit cell values and commit updates in the grid.
description: Configure LyteNyte Grid to modify and update data directly with single-cell editing.
---

To enable cell editing, set the `editMode` property on the grid. `editMode` accepts one of the following values:

- `"cell"`: Edit one cell at a time.
- `"row"`: Edit a row and commit changes per row.
- `"readonly"`: Disable cell editing (default).

:::info
This guide focuses on single-cell editing. For row editing, see the [Full Row Cell Editing guide](/docs/cell-editing-full-row).
:::

## Basic Cell Editing

Set `editMode` to `"cell"` to enable single-cell editing. To make a column editable, set
these column definition properties:

- `editable`: Boolean or predicate function that returns whether the cell
  is editable. Use a predicate to control editability per row.
- `editRenderer`: Component to render in the cell while editing.
  The grid passes [`EditParams`](/docs/reference/grid-types#editing) to
  this component to handle edits.

LyteNyte Grid treats row data as immutable. When a user edits a cell, the
grid triggers the `onRowDataChange` callback. Use this prop to update
your data source. This guide demonstrates cell editing using
the [client row source](/docs/client-source-overview).

In the demo below, the **Price** and **Customer** columns are editable.
To edit a value, double-click any cell in either column.

::demo[Basic Cell Editing="./demos/cell-editing-basic"]

:::note
The demo omits validation to focus on basic editing. For example, it allows negative prices.
See the [Cell Edit Validation guide](/docs/cell-editing-validation) for best practices.
:::

The demo defines basic edit renderers for the **Price** and **Customer** columns.
For custom renderers, see the [Cell Edit Renderers guide](/docs/cell-editing-renderers).

The grid passes [`EditParams`](/docs/reference/grid-types#editing) props to
each edit renderer. This demo uses:

- `editValue`: Current value being edited. It is initialized from the cell's value
  and applied only when you commit the edit.
- `changeValue`: Method that updates `editValue` during editing.

The **Customer** column edit renderer assigns
`editValue` to the `<input />` value, and the input's `onChange` handler calls `changeValue`
to update the edit value. The renderer also converts editValue to a string because
the input element expects a string value, and editValue may not initially be a string.

```tsx
function TextCellEditor({ changeValue, editValue }: Grid.T.EditParams<GridSpec>) {
  return (
    <input
      className="focus:outline-ln-primary-50 h-full w-full px-2"
      value={`${editValue}`} //!
      onChange={(e) => changeValue(e.target.value)} //!
    />
  );
}
```

### Edit Click Activator

Use the `editClickActivator` property on the grid to change the click interaction that
starts cell editing. The property accepts one of three values:

- `"single-click"`: Begins cell editing when the user clicks an editable cell.
- `"double-click"`: Begins cell editing when the user double-clicks an editable cell. This is the default.
- `"none"`: Clicking an editable cell does not start editing.

The demo below enables `single-click` editing on the **Price** and **Customer** columns.
Click any cell in these columns to begin editing.

::demo[Single Click Edit="./demos/cell-editing-click-activator"]

## Edit Parameters

LyteNyte Grid provides each cell edit renderer with props conforming to the
[`EditParams`](/docs/reference/grid-types#editing) type. `EditParams` contains the state and
methods required to manage cell updates. The following sections detail the most
important properties of EditParams.

### Edit Value and Data

To manage cell editing, distinguish between the `editValue` and `editData` properties
on [`EditParams`](/docs/reference/grid-types#editing).

When a cell edit begins, LyteNyte Grid creates a copy of the edited row's data and stores
it in `editData`. The grid then uses the column's `field` property to derive the
`editValue` for the active cell. The pseudo-code below illustrates this process:

```ts
// Start with the column definition and row data for a given row
const column = { id: "customer", field: "customer" };
const row = { customer: "alice", ...otherProperties };

// When the grid begins editing, it creates a copy of the row data
const editData = structuredClone(row);

// The grid uses the column field to derive the editValue
const editValue = editData[column.field ?? column.id];
```

This pseudo-code does not reflect the exact implementation, but it illustrates the core
relationship between `editData` and `editValue`.

Use the `changeValue` method to update `editValue`. This method is a convenience wrapper
around `changeData` that applies updates to a single cell. In contrast, `changeData`
updates the edit data for the entire row. The following two calls are equivalent:

```ts
editParams.changeValue("Alice Smith");
editParams.changeData({ ...editParams.editData, customer: "Alice Smith" });
```

### Edit Setter

Use the `editSetter` property on a column to control how the grid updates `editValue`
when `changeValue` is called.

By default, LyteNyte Grid uses the column's `field` property to update the edit value
for a cell. This behavior works only when `field` refers to a string or numeric property.
When `field` is a function or a path, you must define an `editSetter` so the grid can
apply updates correctly.

For example, the following column definition always title-cases the edited value:

```ts
const column = {
  id: "customer",
  editSetter: ({ editValue, editData }) => ({
    ...editData,
    customer: typeof editValue !== "string" ? "-" : titleCase(editValue),
  }),
};
```

The `editSetter` must always return the full `editData` object, not just the modified
value. Use `editSetter` to enforce update constraints and to create linked cell updates.
For more information, see the [Linked Cell Edits guide](/docs/cell-editing-linked-cell-edits).

### Committing and Cancelling Edits

LyteNyte Grid does not mutate the original row data during an edit.
To end an edit programmatically, `EditParams` provides two methods:

- `commit`: Applies the new value via row update callbacks and ends the edit.
- `cancel`: Discards the edited value and ends the edit.

## Edit Events

LyteNyte Grid fires these events during the cell editing lifecycle.
For the full list, see the [grid props API reference](/docs/reference/grid-props#cell-editing).

- `onEditBegin`: Fires when a cell edit begins. Call `preventDefault` on the event params to prevent the edit.
- `onEditEnd`: Fires when editing ends and the grid is about to commit
  the edited value. Call `preventDefault` on the event params to prevent the commit.
- `onEditCancel`: Fires when editing ends without applying the edited value.
- `onEditFail`: Fires when validation fails during editing.

## Programmatic Editing

LyteNyte Grid's API exposes methods for programmatically editing cells. These methods
support advanced editing scenarios. See the grid's
for detailed usage information.

LyteNyte Grid's API exposes methods for programmatically editing cells. For complete details, see the grid
[API reference](/docs/reference/grid-api#cell-editing).

- `editBegin`: Begins editing a specific cell.
- `editEnd`: Ends the edit and commits the value. Pass `cancel` to cancel instead of commit.
- `editIsCellActive`: Returns `true` if the specified cell is currently being edited.
- `editUpdate`: Updates rows in bulk. See the [Bulk Cell Editing guide](/docs/cell-editing-bulk-editing) for details.

:::note
Use programmatic editing APIs only for advanced scenarios.
For basic cell editing, use LyteNyte Grid's built-in editing behavior.
