step: Edit and update the value of individual cells in the grid.
description: Change the value of cells using LyteNyte Grid's cell editing capabilities.
  Edit a single cell value or the values for a whole row.

To begin editing cells in LyteNyte Grid set the `editMode` property on the grid. This property
accepts one of three values:

- `"cell"`: A single cell will be editable at a time.
- `"row"`: Allows cells to be edited and committed on a row by row basis.
- `"readonly"`: Cell editing is not allowed. This is the default value.

This guide will cover single cell edits, for guidance on full row edits see the
[Full Row Cell Editing guide](/docs/cell-editing-full-row).

## Basic Cell Editing

Start editing cells by setting the `editMode` to `"cell"`. This will enable LyteNyte Grid's cell editing
capabilities. Next you need to make a column editable. Two properties on the column definition
must be set for the cells in a column to be editable:

- `editable`: A boolean or predicate value that determines if the cell is editable. Use a function predicate to
  determine if a cell should be editable on a row by row basis.
- `editRenderer`: This property determines the component LyteNyte Grid should render within the cell's
  bounds. The component will be provided a set of [`EditParams`](/docs/reference) to handle editing the cell.

Finally, LyteNyte Grid will never change the row data provided to it. Instead it will inform the row source
of the changes that have been made, and it is to row source's responsibility to update the row data. Each
row source accepts the `onRowDataChange` callback property. Use this property to handle updates. This
guide will use the [client row source](/docs/client-source-overview) for cell edits.

The demo below demonstrates the basic cell editing capabilities of LyteNyte Grid. The **Price**, **Customer**,
and **Purchase Date** columns are all editable. To begin editing double click on the cells.
