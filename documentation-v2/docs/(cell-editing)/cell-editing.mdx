  This guide focuses on editing a single cell at a time.
---

To enable cell editing in LyteNyte Grid, set the `editMode` property on the grid. This property
accepts one of the following values:

- `"cell"`: Enables editing for a single cell at a time.
- `"row"`: Enables editing and commits changes on a row-by-row basis.
- `"readonly"`: Disables cell editing. This is the default value.

This guide focuses on single-cell editing. For guidance on editing and committing changes
across an entire row, see the [Full Row Cell Editing guide](/docs/cell-editing-full-row).

## Basic Cell Editing

Start editing cells by setting the `editMode` property to `"cell"`. This setting enables
LyteNyte Grid's cell editing capabilities. Two properties
on the column definition are required for cells in a column to be editable:

- `editable`: A boolean or predicate value that determines whether a cell is editable.
  Use a predicate function to control editability on a row-by-row basis.
- `editRenderer`: Determines which component LyteNyte Grid renders within the cell's bounds.
  LyteNyte Grid provides this component with a set of [`EditParams`](/docs/reference) to
  handle cell editing.

LyteNyte Grid never mutates the row data you provide. Instead, the grid notifies the row
source when changes occur, and the row source updates the row data. Each row source
accepts an `onRowDataChange` callback property. Use this property to handle updates.
This guide uses the [client row source](/docs/client-source-overview) for cell edits.

The demo below demonstrates the basic cell editing behavior in LyteNyte Grid. The **Price**
and **Customer** columns are editable. To begin editing, double-click a cell.

::demo[Basic Cell Editing="./demos/cell-editing-basic"]

:::note

The demo does not validate cell edits, as it focuses on the most basic editing functionality.
This means it is possible, for example, to enter a negative price value. See the
[Cell Edit Validation guide](/docs/cell-editing-validation) for guidance on best practices
for validating edits.

:::

The demo defines basic edit renderers for the **Price** and **Customer** columns. See the
[Cell Edit Renderers guide](/docs/cell-editing-renderers) for more detailed coverage of
creating custom edit renderers.

To support editing, LyteNyte Grid passes each edit renderer a set of props that conform to
the [`EditParams`](/docs/reference) type. The demo uses two properties from `EditParams`:

- `editValue`: The current value being edited. This value initially matches the cell value
  and updates as edits occur. LyteNyte Grid applies this value only when the edit is committed.
- `changeValue`: A method that updates the `editValue` during the edit session.

The code for the **Customer** column edit renderer is shown below. The renderer assigns
`editValue` to the `<input />` value, and the input's `onChange` handler calls `changeValue`
to update the edit value. The renderer also converts `editValue` to a string, since the
`input` element expects a string value and `editValue` is not guaranteed to be a string.

```tsx
function TextCellEditor({ changeValue, editValue }: Grid.T.EditParams<GridSpec>) {
  return (
    <input
      className="focus:outline-ln-primary-50 h-full w-full px-2"
      value={`${editValue}`} //!
      onChange={(e) => changeValue(e.target.value)} //!
    />
  );
}
```

### Edit Click Activator

Use the `editClickActivator` property on the grid to change the click interaction that
starts cell editing. The property accepts one of three values:

- `"single"`: Begins cell editing when the user clicks an editable cell.
- `"double-click"`: Begins cell editing when the user double-clicks an editable cell. This is the default.
- `"none"`: Clicking an editable cell does not start editing.

In the demo below, a single click activates cell editing. The **Price** and **Customer**
columns are editable. Click a cell in either column to begin editing.

::demo[Single Click Edits="./demos/cell-editing-click-activator"]

## Edit Parameters

LyteNyte Grid provides each cell edit renderer with a set of props that conform to the
[`EditParams`](/docs/reference) type. `EditParams` contains the methods and state required
to manage cell updates in LyteNyte Grid. The sections below describe the most important
properties on `EditParams`.

### Edit Value and Edit Data

To use cell editing effectively, it is important to understand the relationship between
the `editValue` and `editData` properties on [`EditParams`](/docs/reference).

When a cell edit begins, LyteNyte Grid creates a copy of the row data for the edited row
and assigns this copy to `editData`. The grid then uses the column's `field` property to
derive the `editValue` for the active cell. The pseudo-code below illustrates this process:

```ts
// Start with the column definition and row data for a given row
const column = { id: "customer", field: "customer" };
const row = { customer: "alice", ...otherProperties };

// When the grid begins editing, it creates a copy of the row data
const editData = structuredClone(row);

// The grid uses the column field to derive the editValue
const editValue = editData[column.field ?? column.id];
```

This pseudo-code does not reflect the exact implementation, but it illustrates the core
relationship between `editData` and `editValue`.

Use the `changeValue` method to update `editValue`. This method is a convenience wrapper
around `changeData` that applies updates to a single cell. In contrast, `changeData`
updates the edit data for the entire row. The following two calls are equivalent:

```ts
editParams.changeValue("Alice Smith");
editParams.changeData({ ...editParams.editData, customer: "Alice Smith" });
```

### Edit Setter

Use the `editSetter` property on a column to control how the grid updates `editValue`
when `changeValue` is called.

By default, LyteNyte Grid uses the column's `field` property to update the edit value
for a cell. This behavior works only when `field` refers to a string or numeric property.
When `field` is a function or a path, you must define an `editSetter` so the grid can
apply updates correctly.

For example, the following column definition always title-cases the edited value:

```ts
const column = {
  id: "customer",
  editSetter: ({ editValue, editData }) => ({
    ...editData,
    customer: typeof editValue !== "string" ? "-" : titleCase(editValue),
  }),
};
```

The `editSetter` must always return the full `editData` object, not just the modified
value. Use `editSetter` to enforce update constraints and to create linked cell updates.
For more information, see the [Linked Cell Edits guide](/docs/cell-editing-linked-cell-edits).

### Committing and Cancelling Edits

While a cell edit is active, LyteNyte Grid does not mutate the original row data.
`EditParams` provides two methods to end a cell edit programmatically:

- `commit`: Ends the cell edit and applies the new value by calling the row update callbacks.
- `cancel`: Ends the cell edit without applying the edited value.

## Edit Events

LyteNyte Grid fires edit events at different points in the cell editing lifecycle.
The events below are commonly used. See the [grid props API reference](/docs/reference)
for complete details:

- `onEditBegin`: Fired when a cell edit begins. Call `preventDefault` on the event params
  to prevent the grid from starting the edit.
- `onEditEnd`: Fired when a cell edit ends and the grid is about to commit the value.
  Call `preventDefault` to prevent the update.
- `onEditCancel`: Fired when a cell edit ends and the edited value is not applied.
- `onEditFail`: Fired when a cell edit fails validation.

## Programmatic Editing

LyteNyte Grid's API exposes methods for programmatically editing cells. These methods
support advanced editing scenarios. See the grid's [API reference](/docs/reference)
for detailed usage information.

- `editBegin`: Begins editing a specific cell.
- `editEnd`: Ends the current cell edit. Optionally accepts a `cancel` flag to cancel
  the edit instead of committing it.
- `editIsCellActive`: Returns `true` if the specified cell is currently being edited.
- `editUpdate`: Updates rows in bulk. See the [Bulk Cell Editing guide] for details.

:::note

Use programmatic editing APIs only for advanced or specialized scenarios. For basic
cell editing, rely on LyteNyte Grid's built-in editing behavior.
