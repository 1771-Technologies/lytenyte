description: Change cell values using LyteNyte Grid's cell editing capabilities.
  Edit a single cell or update all cell values in a row.
---

To begin editing cells in LyteNyte Grid, set the `editMode` property on the grid. This property
accepts one of three values:

- `"cell"`: Makes a single cell editable at a time.
- `"row"`: Allows editing and committing changes on a row-by-row basis.
- `"readonly"`: Disables cell editing. This is the default value.

This guide covers single-cell editing. For guidance on full row edits, see the
[Full Row Cell Editing guide](/docs/cell-editing-full-row).

## Basic Cell Editing

Start editing cells by setting the `editMode` property to `"cell"`. This setting enables LyteNyte Grid's cell editing
capabilities. Next, you must make a column editable. Two properties on the column definition
must be set for the cells in a column to be editable:

- `editable`: A boolean or predicate value that determines whether a cell is editable. Use a predicate function to
  determine whether a cell should be editable on a row-by-row basis.
- `editRenderer`: Determines which component LyteNyte Grid renders within the cell's bounds.
  The grid provides the component with a set of [`EditParams`](/docs/reference) to handle cell editing.

LyteNyte Grid never mutates the row data that you provide. Instead, it informs the row source
when changes occur, and the row source is responsible for updating the row data. Each
row source accepts an `onRowDataChange` callback property. Use this property to handle updates.
This guide uses the [client row source](/docs/client-source-overview) for cell edits.

The demo below demonstrates the basic cell editing capabilities of LyteNyte Grid. The **Price** and **Customer**
columns are editable. To begin editing, double-click a cell.

::demo[Basic Cell Editing="./demos/cell-editing-basic"]

:::note

The cell edits in the demo are not validated, as the demo is showing the most basic functionality
for cell editing. This means it's possible to, for example, enter a negative price value. See
the [Cell Edit Validation guide](/docs/cell-editing-validation) for guidances on the best way
to validate edits.

:::

The demo defines basic edit renderers to update values in the **Price** and **Customer** columns.
See the [Cell Edit Renderers guide](/docs/cell-editing-renderers) for more detailed coverage of
creating custom edit renderers.

To support editing, LyteNyte Grid passes each edit renderer a set of props that conform to the
[`EditParams`](/docs/reference) type. The demo uses two properties from `EditParams`:

- `editValue`: The current value being edited. This value initially matches the cell value and updates
  as edits occur. LyteNyte Grid applies this value only when the edit is committed.
- `changeValue`: A method that updates the `editValue` during the edit session.

The code for the **Customer** column's edit renderer is shown below. The renderer assigns `editValue`
to the `<input />` value, and the input's `onChange` handler calls `changeValue` to update the edit
value. The renderer also converts `editValue` to a string, since the `input` element expects a
string value, and the current `editValue` is not guaranteed to be a string.

```tsx
function TextCellEditor({ changeValue, editValue }: Grid.T.EditParams<GridSpec>) {
  return (
    <input
      className="focus:outline-ln-primary-50 h-full w-full px-2"
      value={`${editValue}`} //!
      onChange={(e) => changeValue(e.target.value)} //!
    />
  );
}
```

### Edit Click Activator

Use the `editClickActivator` property on the grid to change the click interaction that
starts cell editing. It accepts one of three values:

- `"single"`: Begins cell editing when an editable cell is clicked.
- `"double-click"`: Begins cell editing when an editable cell is double-clicked. This is the default.
- `"none"`: Clicking an editable cell does not start editing.

In the demo below, a single click activates cell editing. The **Price** and **Customer** columns are
editable. Click a cell in either column to begin editing.

::demo[Single Click Edits="./demos/cell-editing-click-activator"]

## Edit Parameters

LyteNyte Grid provides the cell edit renderer with a set of props that conform to the
[`EditParams`](/docs/reference) type. The `EditParams` type contains the methods and state
required to handle cell updates in LyteNyte Grid. The sections that follow explain the
most important properties on the `EditParams` type.

### Edit Value and Edit Data

To make the most of cell editing, it is important to understand the relationship between the
`editValue` and `editData` properties on the [`EditParams`](/docs/reference).

When a cell edit begins, LyteNyte Grid creates a copy of the row data for the cell
being edited and assigns this copy to `editData`. The grid then uses the `field`
property from the column definition to derive the `editValue` for the cell.
The following pseudo-code illustrates this process:

```ts
// Start with the column definition and row data for a given row
const column = { id: "customer", field: "customer" };
const row = { customer: "alice", ...otherProperties };

// When the grid begins editing, it creates a copy of the row data
const editData = structuredClone(row);

// The grid uses the column field to derive the editValue
const editValue = editData[column.field ?? column.id];
```

The code above only approximates how LyteNyte Grid works, but it illustrates the core relationship
between the `editData` and `editValue` properties.

Use the `changeValue` method to update the `editValue` property. This method is a convenience
wrapper around `changeData`, but it applies updates to a single cell. In contrast,
`changeData` updates the edit data for the entire row. The following two calls are equivalent:

```ts
editParams.changeValue("Alice Smith");
editParams.changeData({ ...editParams.editData, customer: "Alice Smith" });
```

### Edit Setter

Use the `editSetter` property on a column to update the `editValue` whenever the
`changeValue` method is called.

By default, LyteNyte Grid uses the column's `field` property to update the edit value
for a cell. This default behavior works only when `field` refers to a string or numeric
property. When `field` is a function or a path, you must provide an `editSetter`
property on the column so the grid can update the `editValue`.

For example, you can define a column that always title-cases the edited value:

```ts
const column = {
  id: "customer",
  editSetter: ({ editValue, editData }) => ({
    ...editData,
    customer: typeof editValue !== "string" ? "-" : titleCase(editValue),
  }),
};
```

The `editSetter` must always return the full row `editData`, not just the modified
edit value. Use `editSetter` to enforce update constraints and to create linked
cell updates. For more information, see the [Linked Cell Edits guide].

### Committing and Cancelling Edits

While a cell value is being edited, LyteNyte Grid does not mutate the original row data.
The `EditParams` type provides two properties that you can use to end a cell edit
programmatically:

- `commit`: Ends the cell edit and calls the row update callbacks to apply the new cell value.
- `cancel`: Ends the cell edit without applying the edited value.

## Edit Events

LyteNyte Grid fires different edit events at various points in the cell editing process.
These events are listed below. See the [grid props API reference](/docs/reference) for
more detailed information:

- `onEditBegin`: Fired when a cell edit begins. Call `preventDefault` on the provided
  event params to prevent the grid from starting the edit.
- `onEditEnd`: Fired when a cell edit ends and the edit value is about to be committed.
  Call `preventDefault` on the provided event params to prevent the grid from applying
  the update.
- `onEditCancel`: Fired when a cell edit ends and the edited value is not applied.
- `onEditFail`: Fired when a cell edit fails data validation.

## Programmatic Editing

LyteNyte Grid's API provides several methods for programmatically editing cells. These
methods are briefly described below. See the grid's [API reference](/docs/reference)
for more detailed usage information.

- `editBegin`: Begins editing a specific cell in the grid.
- `editEnd`: Ends the current cell edit. This method optionally accepts a `cancel` flag
  to cancel the edit instead of committing it.
- `editIsCellActive`: Returns `true` if the queried cell is currently being edited.
- `editUpdate`: Updates rows in bulk. See the [Bulk Cell Editing guide] for more details.

:::note

LyteNyte Grid provides programmatic cell editing APIs to support more advanced or
specialized editing scenarios. Avoid using these methods for basic cell editing, and
rely on the grid's built-in editing behavior instead.
