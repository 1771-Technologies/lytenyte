title: Cell Editing
step: Edit and update the value of individual cells in the grid.
description: Change the value of cells using LyteNyte Grid's cell editing capabilities.
  Edit a single cell value or the values for a whole row.
---

To begin editing cells in LyteNyte Grid set the `editMode` property on the grid. This property
accepts one of three values:

- `"cell"`: A single cell will be editable at a time.
- `"row"`: Allows cells to be edited and committed on a row by row basis.
- `"readonly"`: Cell editing is not allowed. This is the default value.

This guide will cover single cell edits, for guidance on full row edits see the
[Full Row Cell Editing guide](/docs/cell-editing-full-row).

## Basic Cell Editing

Start editing cells by setting the `editMode` to `"cell"`. This will enable LyteNyte Grid's cell editing
capabilities. Next you need to make a column editable. Two properties on the column definition
must be set for the cells in a column to be editable:

- `editable`: A boolean or predicate value that determines if the cell is editable. Use a function predicate to
  determine if a cell should be editable on a row by row basis.
- `editRenderer`: This property determines the component LyteNyte Grid should render within the cell's
  bounds. The component will be provided a set of [`EditParams`](/docs/reference) to handle editing the cell.

Finally, LyteNyte Grid will never change the row data provided to it. Instead it will inform the row source
of the changes that have been made, and it is to row source's responsibility to update the row data. Each
row source accepts the `onRowDataChange` callback property. Use this property to handle updates. This
guide will use the [client row source](/docs/client-source-overview) for cell edits.

The demo below demonstrates the basic cell editing capabilities of LyteNyte Grid. The **Price** and **Customer**,
are editable. To begin editing double click on the cells.

::demo[Basic Cell Editing="./demos/cell-editing-basic"]

The demo define basic edit renderers to update the values in **Price** or **Customer** columns. See the
[Cell Edit Renderers guide](/docs/cell-editing-renderers) for more thorough coverage on creating custom
edit renderers.

To make editing work, LyteNyte Grid will pass the edit renderer with a set of props conforming to the
[`EditParams`](/docs/reference) type. Two properties on the `EditParams` type are used by the demo:

- `editValue`: The current value being updated. This is initially the current value of the cell, but can be
  updated. This value will be applied only when the cell edit is committed.
- `changeValue`: A method used to update the `editValue` of the cell edit.

The code for the **Customer** column's edit renderer is shown below. Notice how `editValue` is provided to the
value of the `<input />`, and the `onChange` handler of the input calls the `changeValue` to update the edit value.
The `editValue` is also converted to a string value, since this is what the `input` element expects, and there is
not guarantee that the current `editValue` is a string.

```tsx
function TextCellEditor({ changeValue, editValue }: Grid.T.EditParams<GridSpec>) {
  return (
    <input
      className="focus:outline-ln-primary-50 h-full w-full px-2"
      value={`${editValue}`} //!
      onChange={(e) => changeValue(e.target.value)} //!
    />
  );
}
```

## Edit Click Activator

The `editClickActivator` property on the grid may be used to change the click method used
to begin cell editing. It accepted one of three values:

- `"single"`: Begins cell editing whenever an editable cell is clicked.
- `"double-click"`: Begins cell editing whenever an editable cell is double-clicked. This is the default.
- `"none"`: Clicking an editable cell will not begin editing it.

In the demo below a single click will activate cell editing. The **Price** and **Customer** columns are
editable. Try clicking one of the cells in these columns to begin editing.
