## Pulling Data

Use the `pushRequests` method on the server data source to manually trigger server data fetches.
Calling this method bypasses existing request tracking and processes these requests as new.
The grid resolves row data conflicts and cancels pending requests if
the grid resets before the server responds.

Click the **“Request Data”** button in the demo below to manually refresh the
grid, simulating a user-triggered polling update.

::demo[Server Data Pulling="./demos/data-pulling"]

The **“Request Data”** button's `onClick` callback handles the server data fetch:

```tsx
<button
  onClick={() => {
    ds.pushRequests(ds.requestsForView.get());
  }}
>
  Request Data
</button>
```

The demo uses the `requestsForView` atom to fetch data for the current view,
though any request set can be used. If you're unfamiliar with the request interface,
see the [Data Interface guide](/docs/server-data-loading-interface) for more details.

## Pushing Data

Use `pushResponses` on the server data source to push data into LyteNyte Grid.
It accepts complete data responses and applies them to the data source. You
can also generate client-side updates and push them as simulated
server responses, as demonstrated below.

::demo[Server Data Pushing="./demos/data-pushing"]

This example is intentionally simple to highlight the core functionality. Like
the data-pulling example, the main logic runs in the **"Push Data"** button's `onClick`
handler. However, instead of calling `pushRequests`, it calls `pushResponses`
and provides complete responses.

```tsx
<button
  onClick={() => {
    const res = getResponses(
      ds.requestsForView.get(),
      grid.state.rowGroupModel.get(),
      grid.state.aggModel.get(),
    );
    ds.pushResponses(res);
  }}
>
  Push Data
</button>
```

Pushing responses requires understanding the server data source response model and how responses form
the data tree. For details, see the [Data Interface guide](/docs/server-data-loading-interface).
