step: Recover from failed data requests and retry loads.
description: Use the server data source's built-in error recovery mechanisms to manage and retry failed network requests.

## Handling Initial Request Failure

When the server data source initializes, it sends an initial data request. If this fails,
LyteNyte Grid can't retry specific slices because none have loaded.
To recover, reset the grid as demonstrated below:

::demo[Initial Load Error="./demos/error-loading-initial"]

Clicking the **“Retry / Resolve”** button calls the `reset` method on the server data
source, which resends the initial data request to the server.

## Handle Slice Failures

Even after the initial request succeeds, subsequent requests can still fail.
The LyteNyte Grid server data source provides the `retry` method to reattempt failed
data requests. This method clears the error state and resends only the failed requests that
are currently in view; failed requests outside the view are skipped but still have their error state cleared.

In the following demo, scroll down to trigger failed requests.
Click the **“Retry Failed”** button to clear the error state and successfully re-request the affected rows.

::demo[Failed Row Slice="./demos/slice-data-failures"]

### Handling Group Failures

The `retry` method also recovers failed group expansions. Calling it re-requests all errored
fetches associated with that group. In the demo below, expand a group to trigger
an intentional failure, then click the exclamation icon to successfully retry the request.

::demo[Group Expansion Failure="./demos/error-group"]

The `retry` method is invoked in the `GroupCellRenderer` button component:

```tsx
<button
  onClick={() => {
    (grid.state.rowDataSource.get() as RowDataSourceServer<SalaryData>).retry();
  }}
>
  <ExclamationTriangleIcon />
</button>
```
