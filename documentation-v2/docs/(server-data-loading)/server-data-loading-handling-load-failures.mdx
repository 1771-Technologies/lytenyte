  The LyteNyte Grid server data source provides simple mechanisms to recover from request
  errors, making it easy to retry failed requests.

## Handling Initial Request Failure

When the server data source initializes, it sends an initial data request to the server. If this
request fails, LyteNyte Grid can't determine which data slices to re-request because
none have loaded. The simplest solution is to reset the grid,
as shown in the example below.

!demo:Initial Load Error="./demos/error-loading-initial"

Clicking the **"Retry - it will work now"** button calls the `reset` method on
the server data source, which resends the initial data request to the server.

## Handle Slice Failures

Even after the initial request succeeds, subsequent requests can still fail.
The LyteNyte Grid server data source provides the `retry` method to reattempt failed
data requests. This method clears the error state and resends only the failed requests that
are currently in view; failed requests outside the view are skipped but still have their error state cleared.

In the example below, scroll down a few rows to trigger some failed requests. Clicking
the **"Retry Failed"** button clears the error state and re-requests
the affected rows. The subsequent requests will succeed.

!demo:Failed Row Slice="./demos/slice-data-failures"

### Handling Group Failures

The `retry` method also handles failed group expansions. Call it to retry a group
expansion that failed, and all associated errored requests will be retried. In the
example below, expanding a group triggers a failure. Clicking the exclamation icon
retries the failed requests, and the subsequent requests succeed.

!demo:Group Expansion Failure="./demos/error-group"

The `retry` method is invoked in the `GroupCellRenderer` button component:

```tsx
<button
  onClick={() => {
    (grid.state.rowDataSource.get() as RowDataSourceServer<SalaryData>).retry();
  }}
>
  <ExclamationTriangleIcon />
</button>
```
