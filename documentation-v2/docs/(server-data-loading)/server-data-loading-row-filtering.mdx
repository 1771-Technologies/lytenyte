title: Server Row Filtering
pro: true
description: LyteNyte Grid defines several filter models that the server data source can use to filter rows
  on the server. The server may also define its own custom filter model to implement application-specific filtering logic.
---

## Available Filter Models

There are three parts of the LyteNyte Filter Model. Additionally a custom filter model may be defined. These
provide four different ways filters may be applied when using the LyteNyte Grid server data source:

- [Filter Model](/docs/reference): Standard column filters that
  apply predicates to cell values, such as greater than or less than comparisons.
- [Filter In Model](/docs/reference): A tree-set definition used
  for inclusion or exclusion of values.
- [Quick Search](/docs/filter-quick-filter): A string-based search that matches a value across any cell in a row.
- **Custom:** A developer-defined model, not part of the LyteNyte Grid state.
  Developers can define any model structure that suits their application.

## Handling the Filter Model on the Server

LyteNyte Grid's `filterModel` state defines column filters that servers can use for basic filtering.
A server may use this to return only rows that meet a column condition, such as cells greater than a given value.

<Callout type="warn">

The filter logic shown below implements only a subset of LyteNyte Grid's full filter model for
illustration purposes. Additional filters, such as the date filter's quarterly options have been omitted from the
implementation for brevity. Most databases already support equivalent operators, so developers rarely
need to reimplement complex filtering manually.

### Filter Options

Each column filter may include additional options. The server decides whether and how to handle them.
For example, a string filter might look like this:

```ts
{
  kind: "string",
  operator: "contains",
  value: "Star",
  options: {
    trimWhitespace: true
  }
}
```

Here, `trimWhitespace` is `true`. The server reads this flag and trims whitespace from the
filter value before evaluating it. LyteNyte Grid leaves filter interpretation entirely up to
your backend. The server may ignore options or apply them as needed.
The grid expects only that the response includes valid rows for the given query.

## The Filter In Model

The `filterInModel` allows inclusion and exclusion checks for cell values.
These are often called “set filters” or “in filters.” The server must handle two responsibilities:

1. Provide the list of unique filter values available for each column.
2. Filter rows in response to changes in the grid's `filterInModel` state.

### Providing Filter Values

The server data source accepts a `dataInFilterItemFetcher` callback, a function that
returns a `Promise` of filter values for a given column.
LyteNyte Grid calls this function whenever in-filter values are requested for display.

This function receives parameters described by the
[`DataInFilterItemFetcherParams`](/docs/reference/row-data-source#datainfilteritemfetcherparams) interface:

```ts
interface DataInFilterItemFetcherParams<T> {
  readonly grid: Grid<T>;
  readonly column: Column<T>;
  readonly reqTime: number;
}
```

- **`grid`:** Reference to the grid state; you can query sort or group state as needed.
- **`column`:** The column requesting filter items.
- **`reqTime`:** A Unix timestamp for handling request collisions.

The fetcher should return an array (or `Promise`) of [`FilterInFilterItem`](/docs/reference/filters#filterinfilteritem) objects:

```ts
export interface FilterInFilterItem {
  readonly id: string;
  readonly label: string;
  readonly value: unknown;
  readonly groupPath?: string[];
}
```

Each filter item must have a unique `id` for rendering.

- `label`: Displays the filter text.
- `value`: Is used for membership tests and must be storable in a `Set`.
- `groupPath`: Defines hierarchical groupings, such as dates or category trees.

### Applying the In Filter

After fetching filter items, users can include or exclude values.
The example below uses LyteNyte Grid's [Filter Tree](/docs/component-filter-tree)
to display choices for the **Genre** column. Click the funnel icon to open the filter.

<Callout>

Each time the funnel opens, the grid shows a loading indicator. LyteNyte Grid doesn't cache filter
item responses. If needed, cache the responses in your data fetching layer.

!demo:In Filter="./demos/in-filter-server-data"

The in-filter logic runs on the server, allowing full control over interpretation.
For example, the model below excludes specific genres:

```ts
filterInModel: {
  genre: {
    kind: "in",
    operator: "not_in",
    value: new Set(["Drama", "Animation", "Anime"]),
  },
}
```

This filter keeps rows whose `genre` value is **not** _ts`"Drama"`_, _ts`"Animation"`_, or _ts`"Anime"`_.
If a `genre` cell contains multiple values (e.g., _ts`"Comedy, Documentary"`_), the server splits the string and checks each value.
In the demo, filtering ignores case sensitivity, but this behavior can be made configurable.
You have full control over how to interpret filters based on your data model.

## Quick Search

LyteNyte Grid's `quickSearch` property provides a fast way to filter rows by string matching across all columns.
The grid can send this value to the server for server side search, though this approach is practical only for small datasets.
Large scale string matching is costly, even for optimized databases.

The demo below uses the search term _ts`"movie"`_, which keeps only rows containing that string. Try typing _ts`"drama"`_ to test it.

!demo:Quick Search="./demos/filtered-quick-search"

<Callout type="warn">

The example's _tsx`<input />`_ is not debounced for simplicity. In production, debounce
the search input to avoid redundant server requests. For a guide on debouncing
see [this article](https://dev.to/manishkc104/debounce-input-in-react-3726).

</Callout>

## External Filters

Depending on your application, you may need a custom filter model.
You can integrate external filters into the data-fetching pipeline by injecting them into the `dataFetcher` function of
the server data source. This can be done using the `dataFetchExternals` property on the server data source.
This property accepts an array of dependencies, and will invalidate the `dataFetcher` function and refetch
data from the server whenever one of the dependencies changes.

The following demo uses the `dataFetchExternals` property to toggle between `Movies` and `TV Shows`:

!demo:External Filter="./demos/external-filter"

This is one of many ways to use external filters. With the right state
management tools, you can build more advanced integrations. The key is ensuring your `dataFetchExternals`
dependencies are stable and only change when necessary.
