pro: true
step: Pin rows to keep specific data visible.
description: Pin rows to the top or bottom of the viewport to keep them visible.
  With a server data source, the server returns these in a pinned-row response.

## Server Pinned Rows

The server data source does not track viewport changes for pinned rows because they remain fixed.
To supply pinned rows, return a `DataResponsePinned` object for every viewport request, including the
initial load. For details, see the [Data Interface guide](/docs/server-data-loading-interface).

This example pins rows to the top or bottom of the grid. The server always returns
both pinned and scrollable rows. Note that pinned rows are always leaf rows.

## Pushing Pinned Row Updates

The server can update pinned rows on any server data source request.
To update pinned rows without a viewport change, call the server data source's `pushResponses` method:

```ts
const ds = useServerDataSource<MovieData>({
  queryFn: (params) => {
    return Server(params.requests);
  },
  //...
});

// Push responses
ds.pushResponses(...)
```

The `pushResponses` method lets the client push response objects into
the server data source as if the server returned them.

In the demo below, **Pin One Top** pins a single row to the top, and
**Remove Pinned** removes the pinned row. Both actions run
on the client without a server response.

`pushResponses` is one way to push data into the grid. For more
details, see the [Data Pushing and Pulling guide](/docs/server-data-loading-push-and-pull).
