title: Server Row Pinning
pro: true
step: Pin rows to keep specific data visible.
description: You can pin specific rows to the top or bottom of the grid's viewport.
  Pinned rows stay visible while the user scrolls. When using a server data
  source, the server manages pinned rows through a pinned row response.

## Returning Pinned Rows From the Server

LyteNyte Grid's server data source doesn't track viewport changes for
pinned rows because pinned rows never move. They stay fixed
at the top or bottom of the grid's viewport.

To supply pinned rows, the server should respond with a
`DataResponsePinned` object on any viewport request, including the initial
load. For details on `DataResponsePinned`, see
the [Data Interface guide](/docs/server-data-loading-interface) and
the [API reference](/docs/reference).

This example pins rows to the top or bottom of the grid. The server implementation in the example
always responds with data for pinned rows along side the data for the scrollable rows. Pinned rows
will always be leaf rows.

## Pushing Pinned Row Updates

Each time the server data source requests more rows, the server can also
update the grid's pinned rows. Sometimes, pinned rows need updating even when the
viewport hasn't changed. In those cases, the server data source can push pinned rows
into the grid programmatically using the `pushResponses` method:

```ts
const ds = useServerDataSource<MovieData>({
  queryFn: (params) => {
    return Server(params.requests);
  },
  //...
});

// Push responses
ds.pushResponses(...)
```

This method lets the client push response objects into the server data source
as if they were returned from the server.

The example below shows its usage. The **Pin One Top** button pins a single row
to the top, and the **Remove Pinned** button removes it. Both actions are triggered entirely
from the client without any server response.

Using the `pushResponses` method is one way to push data into the grid.
