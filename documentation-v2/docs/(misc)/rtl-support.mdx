title: RTL Support
step: Configure right-to-left mode in LyteNyte Grid.
description: Enable Right-to-Left (RTL) rendering in LyteNyte Grid with a single
  configuration change.
---

LyteNyte Grid fully supports Right-to-Left (RTL) rendering.
Enable RTL by setting the `rtl` property on the grid.

:::note

LyteNyte Grid uses [logical CSS properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_logical_properties_and_values)
throughout its codebase. This approach ensures that RTL works seamlessly without requiring additional styling changes.
You only need to set the `rtl` flag—no other configuration is required.

:::

Set the `rtl` flag directly on the grid. The grid does not detect RTL
based on the CSS `direction` property of the viewport or any parent element.
