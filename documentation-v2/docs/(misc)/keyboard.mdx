LyteNyte Grid provides keyboard bindings to improve navigation, editing, and accessibility.
It follows the [ARIA Grid Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/grid/) and
adds custom keyboard bindings for advanced interactions. Read the ARIA pattern first,
then use this guide for the LyteNyte additions.

## Navigation

Use the arrow keys (`←`, `→`, `↑`, `↓`) to move between header and grid
cells. The `←` and `→` arrow keys cycle through all tabbable elements
within a cell before moving to the next cell. This behavior differs
slightly from the ARIA Grid Pattern's recommended navigation model,
but it provides a more efficient navigation experience.

You can combine the arrow keys with your keyboard's meta modifier to
navigate to the bounds of the grid:

- `Ctrl →`: Jump to the last cell in the current row or header.
- `Ctrl ←`: Jump to the first cell in the current row or header.
- `Ctrl ↑`: Focus the first row (when a grid cell is focused).
- `Ctrl ↓`: Focus the last row (when a grid cell is focused).

:::note

On macOS, you can use the `Cmd` key instead of the `Ctrl` key.

:::

In addition to the arrow keys, LyteNyte Grid supports the following
navigation keybindings:

- `PageDown`: Move focus down by approximately the number of rows currently in view.
- `PageUp`: Move focus up by approximately the number of rows currently in view.
- `Home`: Move focus to the first cell of the current row, equivalent to `Ctrl ←`.
- `End`: Move focus to the last cell of the current row, equivalent to `Ctrl →`.
- `Ctrl Home`: Move focus to the first cell in the first row.
- `Ctrl End`: Move focus to the last cell in the last row.

### Tab Order

LyteNyte Grid orders DOM elements to match the visual layout and sets
the viewport and cells to `tabIndex=0`. With this configuration,
`Tab` would normally follow the DOM order. However, the grid
treats the viewport as a single tab stop, except during cell editing.

Pressing `Tab` moves focus to the next element outside the
grid, so users don't tab through every cell before reaching the next focus group.

### Row Detail Navigation

Navigate expanded row details using the keyboard.
When a cell is focused and the row is expanded, press `↓` to focus the detail container.
Press `↓` again to move to the next row.

The demo supports all navigation bindings. Use it to explore the grid's response to inputs.

## Cell Selection

When `cellSelectionMode` is set to `range`, you can use the following
keybindings to modify the selection. See the
[Cell Range Selection guide](/docs/cell-selection)
for detailed guidance.

- `Shift →`: Expand or shrink the selection one column to the right.
- `Shift ←`: Expand or shrink the selection one column to the left.
- `Shift ↑`: Expand or shrink the selection one row up.
- `Shift ↓`: Expand or shrink the selection one row down.
- `Ctrl Shift →`: Expand or shrink the selection to the last column on the right.
- `Ctrl Shift ←`: Expand or shrink the selection to the last column on the left.
- `Ctrl Shift ↑`: Expand or shrink the selection to the first row.
- `Ctrl Shift ↓`: Expand or shrink the selection to the last row.
- `Ctrl A`: Select all cells in the grid.

Selection expansion depends on the current selection rectangle and the
pivot cell, which is the focused cell. Use the demo below to explore selection bindings.

## Editable Cells

When cell editing is enabled, LyteNyte Grid adds additional keybindings
to make keyboard-based editing intuitive. See the
[Cell Editing guide](/docs/cell-editing)
for details on updating cell values.

- Press `Enter` to enter edit mode.
- Press `Enter` again to confirm and commit the edit.
- Press `Esc` to cancel the edit.
- Press any printable character to enter edit mode and set the cell
  value to the pressed character.

## Key Binding Customization

LyteNyte Grid is headless, so you can add custom keybindings by
handling the component's `onKeyDown`.

The demo below binds `Space` to row selection. Double-click
a row to select it, or focus a cell and press `Space`. For more details, see
the [Row Selection guide](/docs/row-selection).

::demo[Row Selection Keybindings="./demos/row-selection-space"]

Use the `events` property to attach custom handlers without
switching to a fully headless implementation. The example below adds
a custom keybinding using the grid's `events` property.

```tsx
<Grid
  columns={columns}
  columnBase={base}
  rowSource={ds}
  rowSelectionMode="multiple"
  rowSelectionActivator="double-click"
  events={useMemo<Grid.Events<GridSpec>>(() => {
    return {
      row: {
        //!next 9
        keyDown: (p) => {
          if (p.event.key === " ") {
            p.event.preventDefault();
            p.api.rowSelect({
              selected: p.row.id,
              deselect: p.api.rowIsSelected(p.row.id),
            });
          }
        },
      },
    };
  }, [])}
/>
```

If you use the fully headless grid setup, the equivalent implementation
is shown below. See the
[Headless Component Parts guide](/docs/grid-headless-parts)
for more details.

```tsx
<Grid
  columns={columns}
  columnBase={base}
  rowSource={ds}
  rowSelectionMode="multiple"
  rowSelectionActivator="double-click"
  ref={apiRef}
>
  <Grid.RowsContainer>
    <Grid.RowsCenter>
      {(row) => {
        if (row.kind === "full-width") return null;

        return (
          <Grid.Row
            key={row.id}
            row={row}
            //!next 10
            onKeyDown={(ev) => {
              if (ev.key === " ") {
                ev.preventDefault();

                apiRef.current?.rowSelect({
                  selected: row.id,
                  deselect: apiRef.current.rowIsSelected(row.id),
                });
              }
            }}
          >
            {row.cells.map((cell) => {
              return <Grid.Cell cell={cell} key={cell.id} />;
            })}
          </Grid.Row>
        );
      }}
    </Grid.RowsCenter>
  </Grid.RowsContainer>
</Grid>
```

### Overwriting Existing Bindings

LyteNyte Grid registers all default keybindings on the `Grid.Viewport`
element. If you provide a handler that prevents the default behavior
or stops event propagation, LyteNyte Grid will not activate its built-in
keybindings.

The example below prevents all default grid keybindings. Modify this
pattern carefully to match your application's requirements.

```tsx
<Grid
  columns={columns}
  columnBase={base}
  rowSource={ds}
  rowSelectionMode="multiple"
  rowSelectionActivator="double-click"
  events={useMemo<Grid.Events<GridSpec>>(() => {
    return {
      //!next 5
      viewport: {
        keyDown: (p) => {
          p.event.preventDefault();
        },
      },
    };
  }, [])}
/>
```

:::warn

Overriding or disabling LyteNyte Grid's default keybindings is not
recommended. These keybindings are designed to maximize accessibility.
Changing or preventing them will reduce the overall accessibility of
your application.

## Touch Interactions

LyteNyte Grid supports touch devices.
Browser `click` events fire on tap, and the grid uses these events for
its interaction handlers.
