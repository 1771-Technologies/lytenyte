  editing, and touch interaction.

LyteNyte Grid supports extensive keyboard shortcuts to improve
navigation, editing, and accessibility. It follows the
[ARIA Grid Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/grid/) and
adds extra keybindings for power users. Read the ARIA pattern first,
then use this guide for LyteNyte-specific bindings.

## Navigation

Use the arrow keys (`←`, `→`, `↑`, `↓`) to move between header and grid
cells. The `←` and `→` arrow keys cycle through all tabbable elements
within a cell before moving to the next cell. This behavior differs
slightly from the ARIA Grid Pattern's recommended navigation model,
but it provides a more efficient navigation experience.

You can combine the arrow keys with your keyboard's meta modifier to
navigate to the bounds of the grid:

- `Ctrl →`: Jump to the last cell in the current row or header.
- `Ctrl ←`: Jump to the first cell in the current row or header.
- `Ctrl ↑`: Focus the first row (when a grid cell is focused).
- `Ctrl ↓`: Focus the last row (when a grid cell is focused).

:::note

On macOS, you can use the `Cmd` key instead of the `Ctrl` key.

:::

In addition to the arrow keys, LyteNyte Grid supports the following
navigation keybindings:

- `PageDown`: Move focus down by approximately the number of rows currently in view.
- `PageUp`: Move focus up by approximately the number of rows currently in view.
- `Home`: Move focus to the first cell of the current row, equivalent to `Ctrl ←`.
- `End`: Move focus to the last cell of the current row, equivalent to `Ctrl →`.
- `Ctrl Home`: Move focus to the first cell in the first row.
- `Ctrl End`: Move focus to the last cell in the last row.

### Tab Order

LyteNyte Grid orders DOM elements to match their visual layout.
If you inspect the DOM, you will see that the grid viewport and each
cell have a `tabIndex` of `0`.

Normally, this configuration would cause pressing `Tab` to move focus
to the next element in the natural DOM order. However, LyteNyte Grid
treats the viewport as a single tab stop, except when cell editing
is active.

A single `Tab` press moves focus to the next element outside the grid.
This behavior prevents users from tabbing through every cell before
reaching the next focus group.

### Row Detail Navigation

LyteNyte Grid supports keyboard navigation within row detail elements.
When a row has a focused cell and its row detail is expanded, pressing
`↓` moves focus to the detail container. Pressing `↓` again while the
detail container is focused moves focus to the next row.

The demo below supports all navigation keybindings covered so far.
Use it to explore how the grid responds to different navigation inputs.

::demo[Grid Navigation="../(introduction)/demos/getting-started"]

## Cell Selection

When `cellSelectionMode` is set to `range`, you can use the following
keybindings to modify the selection. See the
[Cell Range Selection guide](/docs/cell-selection)
for detailed guidance.

- `Shift →`: Expand or shrink the selection one column to the right.
- `Shift ←`: Expand or shrink the selection one column to the left.
- `Shift ↑`: Expand or shrink the selection one row up.
- `Shift ↓`: Expand or shrink the selection one row down.
- `Ctrl Shift →`: Expand or shrink the selection to the last column on the right.
- `Ctrl Shift ←`: Expand or shrink the selection to the last column on the left.
- `Ctrl Shift ↑`: Expand or shrink the selection to the first row.
- `Ctrl Shift ↓`: Expand or shrink the selection to the last row.
- `Ctrl A`: Select all cells in the grid.

Whether the selection expands or shrinks depends on the current
selection rectangle and the pivot cell. The pivot cell is the cell
that currently has focus.

The demo below enables cell selection. Use it to explore the available
selection keybindings.

::demo[Cell Selection="../(cells)/demos/cell-selection"]

## Editable Cells

When cell editing is enabled, LyteNyte Grid adds additional keybindings
to make keyboard-based editing intuitive. See the
[Cell Editing guide](/docs/cell-editing)
for details on updating cell values.

- Press `Enter` to enter edit mode.
- Press `Enter` again to confirm and commit the edit.
- Press `Esc` to cancel the edit.
- Press any printable character to enter edit mode and set the cell
  value to the pressed character.

## Key Binding Customization

Because LyteNyte Grid is headless, you can add custom keybindings by
attaching handlers to the component's `onKeyDown` events.

The demo below binds the `Space` key to row selection. See the
[Row Selection guide](/docs/row-selection)
for more information. In the demo, you can either double-click a row
to select it or focus a cell and press the space key.

::demo[Row Selection With Space Key="./demos/row-selection-space"]

The example below adds a custom keybinding using the grid's `events`
property. The `events` property allows you to attach custom event
handlers without breaking the grid into fully headless components.

```tsx
<Grid
  columns={columns}
  columnBase={base}
  rowSource={ds}
  rowSelectionMode="multiple"
  rowSelectionActivator="double-click"
  events={useMemo<Grid.Events<GridSpec>>(() => {
    return {
      row: {
        //!next 9
        keyDown: (p) => {
          if (p.event.key === " ") {
            p.event.preventDefault();
            p.api.rowSelect({
              selected: p.row.id,
              deselect: p.api.rowIsSelected(p.row.id),
            });
          }
        },
      },
    };
  }, [])}
/>
```

If you use the fully headless grid setup, the equivalent implementation
is shown below. See the
[Headless Component Parts guide](/docs/grid-headless-parts)
for more details.

```tsx
<Grid
  columns={columns}
  columnBase={base}
  rowSource={ds}
  rowSelectionMode="multiple"
  rowSelectionActivator="double-click"
  ref={apiRef}
>
  <Grid.RowsContainer>
    <Grid.RowsCenter>
      {(row) => {
        if (row.kind === "full-width") return null;

        return (
          <Grid.Row
            key={row.id}
            row={row}
            //!next 10
            onKeyDown={(ev) => {
              if (ev.key === " ") {
                ev.preventDefault();

                apiRef.current?.rowSelect({
                  selected: row.id,
                  deselect: apiRef.current.rowIsSelected(row.id),
                });
              }
            }}
          >
            {row.cells.map((cell) => {
              return <Grid.Cell cell={cell} key={cell.id} />;
            })}
          </Grid.Row>
        );
      }}
    </Grid.RowsCenter>
  </Grid.RowsContainer>
</Grid>
```

### Overwriting Existing Bindings

LyteNyte Grid registers all default keybindings on the `Grid.Viewport`
element. If you provide a handler that prevents the default behavior
or stops event propagation, LyteNyte Grid will not activate its built-in
keybindings.

The example below prevents all default grid keybindings. Modify this
pattern carefully to match your application's requirements.

```tsx
<Grid
  columns={columns}
  columnBase={base}
  rowSource={ds}
  rowSelectionMode="multiple"
  rowSelectionActivator="double-click"
  events={useMemo<Grid.Events<GridSpec>>(() => {
    return {
      //!next 5
      viewport: {
        keyDown: (p) => {
          p.event.preventDefault();
        },
      },
    };
  }, [])}
/>
```

:::warn

Overriding or disabling LyteNyte Grid's default keybindings is not
recommended. These keybindings are designed to maximize accessibility.
Changing or preventing them will reduce the overall accessibility of
your application.

## Touch Interactions

LyteNyte Grid works seamlessly on touch devices. Browser `click` events
fire on tap, and the grid uses these events for its interaction
handlers.
