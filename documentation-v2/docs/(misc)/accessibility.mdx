Accessibility ensures that all users can navigate and interact with your
application, regardless of ability. LyteNyte Grid provides robust,
standards-compliant accessibility features. This guide outlines the key
capabilities and best practices.

## Accessibility Compliance

LyteNyte Grid meets the W3C's [WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) guidelines.
It supports all three conformance levels—A, AA, and AAA. Meeting AA
requirements also satisfies most [ADA](https://www.ada.gov/) standards.

The grid uses ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes on
rows, cells, and headers. Screen readers interpret these attributes to
help visually impaired users understand the grid's structure and content.

## DOM Ordering

LyteNyte Grid renders cells and headers in natural DOM order, even when virtualization
is enabled. This ensures that screen reader users can correctly parse content.
No special configuration is required to enhance the grid's accessibility.

## ARIA Roles and Properties

LyteNyte Grid applies ARIA roles and properties to remain spec-compliant
and accessible.

### Grid Roles

The main container uses `role="grid"`. It also applies:

- `aria-rowcount`: total rows in the grid
- `aria-colcount`: total columns in the grid
- `aria-multiselectable="true"`: only when multiple row selection is
  enabled

### Row Roles

The grid uses `role="row"` for individual rows and `role="rowgroup"` for
row containers.

For `role="row"`, the grid adds:

- `aria-rowindex`: the row's position in the grid
- `aria-selected`: whether the row is selected

### Header Cell Roles

Headers use `role="columnheader"` and may include:

- `aria-colindex`: the column's position in the grid
- `aria-expanded`: open or collapsed state

### Grid Cell Roles

Cells use `role="gridcell"` and may include:

- `aria-colindex`: the column's position in the grid

## Considerations for Visual Accessibility

### Screen Readers

LyteNyte Grid works with major screen readers, including:

- [JAWS](https://support.freedomscientific.com/Downloads/JAWS)
- [VoiceOver](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/voiceover/welcome/10)

The grid follows W3C standards to ensure a smooth, predictable reading
experience.

### Color Accessibility

Roughly 300 million people worldwide experience some form of color
blindness ([source](https://www.colourblindawareness.org/colour-blindness/)).
Use accessible colors to meet AA standards and maintain readability.

LyteNyte Grid provides prebuilt grid themes and color design tokens. These
themes are designed to be accessible and spec-compliant.

Beyond the themes provided by LyteNyte Grid, choosing a strong color palette
for your application is essential for maintaining accessibility.
Some recommended palettes include:

- [Radix UI Colors](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors)
- [Tailwind Colors](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors)

Accessible color choices help keep data visually clear for all users.

LyteNyte Grid embeds accessibility into its core design. Use ARIA roles,
test with screen readers, and choose inclusive color palettes to deliver
a grid that works for everyone. Regularly test with assistive
technologies to maintain a seamless, inclusive experience.
