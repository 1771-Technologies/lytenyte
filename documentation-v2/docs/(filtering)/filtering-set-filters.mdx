:::note

How you apply a date filter in LyteNyte Grid depends on the row source you use.
See the following guides for each supported row data source:

- [Client Row Filtering](/docs/client-source-filtering)
- [Server Row Filtering](/docs/server-data-loading-row-filtering)
- [Paginated Row Filtering](/docs/paginated-rs-row-filtering)
- [Infinite Row Filtering](/docs/infinite-rs-row-filtering)
- [Tree Filtering](/docs/tree-source-filtering)

This guide focuses on client row filtering, since server-side filtering is typically handled by your backend database.
The concepts in this guide apply equally to all row sources.

## Basic Set Filtering

A set filter will check a cell's value for membership in a set of values. There are two possible checks
that can be made. The two options are the inverse of each other.

- **Inclusion:** Checks if the cell's value is present in the set of allowed values.
- **Exclusion:** Checks if the cell's value is missing from the set of disallowed values.

Implementing a set filter in LyteNyte Grid involves creating a filter function that captures the
set of values and accepts a [row node](/docs/row-overview). The filter function should return
`true` to keep the row or `false` to remove it.

The demo below demonstrates a basic set filter in action. You can type in the filter query to select
the categories you would like to view. Only the selected categories will be kept.
