  general guidelines worth following. This section covers those best practices.

## Debounce Filter Inputs

Many filters require user input. If you apply a filter immediately as the user enters
values, ensure that you debounce the input. Applying filters on every keystroke is not
recommended, since each change often requires re-evaluating all filter operations for
every row.

For more information on debouncing as a pattern, see the
[MDN Debounce guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Debounce).

## Handle Null Values

Always account for `null` values. In your filter logic, make a deliberate decision about
whether `null` values should be kept or removed. The presence of `null` values is often
an afterthought, but handling them incorrectly can make filter implementations more complex
and less predictable.

## Ensure Filter Efficiency

Filters run against every row in the grid, so filter performance is critical. Ensure that
filter functions are efficient, and avoid heavy computations inside filter logic.

Some LyteNyte Grid row sources accept an array of filter functions, such as the
[client row source](/docs/client-source-filtering). The grid evaluates filter functions
in the order provided. Order filters from most efficient to least efficient to
maximize performance.

## Display Filter Feedback

Always provide a visible indication that filters are active. This feedback can be as simple
as a filter icon or a subtle but noticeable color indicator. Use consistent visual cues for
filter feedback, and always provide a clear way to remove or reset filters.
