title: Quick Search Filtering
step: Quickly find rows based on simple text searches.
description: A quick search filter uses a query string to filter rows by checking
  the search term against all or selected values in a row.

:::note

How you apply a quick search filter in LyteNyte Grid depends on the row source you use.
See the following guides for each supported row data source:

- [Client Row Filtering](/docs/client-source-filtering)
- [Server Row Filtering](/docs/server-data-loading-row-filtering)
- [Tree Filtering](/docs/tree-source-filtering)

This guide focuses on client row filtering, since server-side filtering is typically handled by your backend database.
The concepts in this guide apply equally to all row sources.

## Searching

The simplest way to implement a quick search is to provide the grid with a filter function that performs
a string inclusion check.

The demo below demonstrates quick search in action. The demo uses a simple case-insensitive inclusion match.
You can implement more advanced fuzzy searching by using external libraries such as
[Fuse.js](https://www.fusejs.io/).

::demo[Quick Search="./demos/quick-search"]

To implement quick search, the demo defines a query value and uses that value to create a filter function.
The filter function is then passed to the data source.

```ts
const [query, setQuery] = useState("");

const filterFn = useMemo(() => {
  if (!query) return null;

  return (row: Grid.T.RowLeaf<GridSpec["data"]>) => {
    const d = row.data;
    const stringValue = `${d.customer} ${d.email} ${d.paymentMethod} ${d.product} ${d.productDescription} ${d.purchaseDate} ${d.cardNumber}`;

    return stringValue.toLowerCase().includes(query.toLowerCase());
  };
}, [query]);
```

An `input` element updates the query value. The input is debounced to ensure that the filter does not run
on every keystroke, as shown in the following example.

```tsx
<input
  data-ln-input
  onChange={(e) => {
    const value = e.target.value;

    if (t.current) clearTimeout(t.current);

    // Simple debounce
    t.current = setTimeout(() => {
      setQuery(value);
      t.current = null;
    }, 100);
  }}
/>
```
