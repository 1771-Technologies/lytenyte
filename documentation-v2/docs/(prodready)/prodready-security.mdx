This guide outlines key security considerations when using LyteNyte Grid.
These guidelines apply to both the free **Core edition** and the **commercial PRO edition**.

## Content Security Policy

LyteNyte Grid may require specific Content Security Policy (CSP) settings. If you need background on CSP, see the
[MDN article on Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP).

### Style Source CSP

To enable LyteNyte Grid's full feature set, the `style-src` directive in your CSP
must include `unsafe-inline`. This directive supports advanced layout and
virtualization features. Add the following tag to your HTML if your framework does not already provide it:

```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';" />
```

:::info

Add this tag only if you use a custom in-house meta framework. Popular frameworks such as
Vite, React Router, TanStack Start, and Next.js already provide the necessary tags.

:::

LyteNyte Grid requires `unsafe-inline`, but its implementation of inline styles
is designed to minimize risk. Inline styles can contribute to XSS
vulnerabilities when used improperly. LyteNyte Grid mitigates these risks through:

- **Sanitization:** All style definitions are validated before use to prevent malicious content.
- **Controlled Execution Context:** Inline styles are generated only within tightly controlled internal logic.
- **Content Isolation:** Dynamically created elements avoid sensitive parts of the DOM and prevent script execution.
- **Framework Compatibility:** Frameworks commonly paired with LyteNyte Grid include additional mechanisms that safely handle inline styles.

These protections allow LyteNyte Grid to use inline styles without compromising your
application's security. Many modern frameworks also include `unsafe-inline` in their CSP defaults for similar reasons.

## Secure Data Transportation

LyteNyte Grid runs entirely in the browser. It does not perform any server communication.
Your application is responsible for retrieving and securing all data before passing it to the grid.

## Avoidance of Attack Vectors

LyteNyte Grid avoids JavaScript features commonly associated with security exploits:

- The code base never uses `eval`, and future versions of LyteNyte Grid will not introduce it.
- LyteNyte Grid does not modify the `prototype` chain of any object.
- The library has **no external dependencies**, ensuring that no
  third-party code is downloaded during installation.

We actively monitor and work to keep our codebase free of vulnerabilities,
continuously enhancing our defenses against new threats. If
you discover a security issue, email [support@1771technologies.com](mailto:support@1771technologies.com).
Our team will address the issue promptly.

## Telemetry and Remote Checks

LyteNyte Grid **does not** collect telemetry and performs no remote validation checks.
The library works entirely offline and supports sandboxed environments. No firewall configuration is required.
