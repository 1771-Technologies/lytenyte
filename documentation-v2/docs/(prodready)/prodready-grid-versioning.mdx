## Semantic Versioning

All LyteNyte Grid packages follow [semver](https://semver.org/) versioning.
Each version consists of three numbers (major.minor.patch), such as `1.2.0`.

Each number represents a different type of release:

- **Major:** Introduces breaking changes that require updates in your application.
- **Minor:** Adds new, backward-compatible features and works with your existing code.
- **Patch:** Includes bug fixes and small improvements.

We refer to minor and patch releases as **updates**, while **major** releases are treated as **upgrades**.

## Release Cadence

LyteNyte Grid does not follow a fixed release schedule.
Bug fixes ship as soon as they pass internal testing.

Although major releases may introduce significant new capabilities, we prioritize
stability and aim to avoid breaking changes. Most enhancements are
delivered as backward-compatible minor updates.

When a release adds substantial new functionality, we may publish a new major version even if there are no breaking changes.
Breaking changes are always documented in the [changelog](/docs/changelog/latest).
While not every major release contains breaking changes, any breaking change will
trigger a major version bump. This ensures your application remains stable when updating only minor versions.

### Checking for the Latest Version

You can find the latest published version of LyteNyte Grid on the NPM Registry:

- **[LyteNyte Grid Core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@1771technologies/lytenyte-core)**
- **[LyteNyte Grid PRO](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@1771technologies/lytenyte-pro)**

### Fixed Versioning

LyteNyte Grid packages use a fixed versioning scheme. The code base is a monorepo,
and all packages are released under the same version number. As a result, the
LyteNyte Grid Core and LyteNyte Grid PRO packages always share the same version,
even when a change affects only one package.

## LyteNyte Grid PRO Version Access

When you purchase a LyteNyte Grid PRO license, you receive **12 months
of dedicated technical support and access to the latest software versions.**
These 12 months are known as your **license period.**

You may use any version of LyteNyte Grid PRO released within your
active license period **indefinitely.** However, versions released after your
license expires require a new license purchase or renewal.
