There are a number open source libraries the allow you to create excel files in JavaScript. This
guide will use [ExcelJS](https://github.com/exceljs/exceljs), but you may consider other
suitable choices as well, such as [SheetJs](https://sheetjs.com/).

## Download an Excel File

The demo below allows you to download an excel file of all the grid data. It does this
by leveraging ExeclJS to create an file blob that is then downloaded.

::demo[Excel Export="./demos/excel-export"]

Notice the code uses the grid's [`exportData`](/docs/reference) method to retrieve
the current view of cells.

```tsx
<button
  //!next 8
  onClick={async () => {
    const api = apiRef.current;
    if (!api) return;

    const rect = await api.exportData();

    downloadBlob(await getExcelFile(rect), "data.xlsx");
  }}
>
  Download Excel File
</button>
```
