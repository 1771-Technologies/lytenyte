title: Export Overview
step: Export grid data in custom formats using LyteNyte Grid's flexible data export API.
description: LyteNyte Grid supports exporting grid data in a structured form that can then be
  used to create files in different formats or written to the clipboard.
---

Many file formats exist for representing and storing data. Rather than implementing each
format directly in the grid, LyteNyte Grid provides the
[`exportData`](/docs/reference/grid-api) method on the grid API.

## Export Data

The `exportData` method exports a rectangular area of data from the grid. This rectangular
area is defined by a start and end column and a start and end row, with the end values
being exclusive. The rectangle interface is shown below.

```ts
interface DataRect {
  readonly rowStart: number;
  readonly rowEnd: number;
  readonly columnStart: number;
  readonly columnEnd: number;
}
```

If you call `exportData` without any arguments, the grid exports data for a rectangle that
covers the entire grid. The examples below show the two ways to call `exportData`.

```ts
// Export a specific area of the grid.
api.exportData({ rect: { columnStart: 2, columnEnd: 10, rowStart: 2, rowEnd: 8 } });

// Export everything.
api.exportData();
```

The `exportData` method returns a `Promise<ExportDataRectResult>` object. The interface for
this result is shown below. Each property on `ExportDataRectResult` is an array, and the
length of each array matches the size of the requested rectangle. LyteNyte Grid performs
the work of returning only the data for the requested columns and rows.

```ts
interface ExportDataRectResult<Spec extends GridSpec = GridSpec> {
  readonly headers: string[];
  readonly groupHeaders: (string | null)[][];
  readonly data: unknown[][];
  readonly columns: Column<Spec>[];
}
```

## Export Files

The primary use case for `exportData` is creating file exports from LyteNyte Grid, although
the API is not limited to file generation. For format-specific implementations, see the
guides below:

- [Excel export](/docs/export-excel)
- [CSV export](/docs/export-csv)
- [Parquet export](/docs/export-parquet)
- [Arrow export](/docs/export-arrow)
- [Clipboard export](/docs/export-clipboard)
