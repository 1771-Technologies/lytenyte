title: Tree Filtering
pro: true
step: Remove tree data rows by providing a custom filter function.
description: Filter tree rows by passing a predicate function to the tree data source.
  The predicate runs for each row and determines whether the grid includes it.

## Filtering Tree Rows

Set the `filter` property on the `useTreeDataSource` hook to filter rows created from the
object provided to the `data` property of the tree data source.

The `filter` property accepts a predicate function that receives each value from the object
provided to `data`. If the function returns `true`, the value and any of its children
are kept; otherwise, they are removed.

In this demo, hidden files are defined as files whose names start with a `.`, like `.env`.
Use the **Reveal Hidden Files** switch to toggle their visibility.
