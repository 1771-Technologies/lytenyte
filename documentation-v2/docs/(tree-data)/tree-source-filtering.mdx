  LyteNyte Grid calls this predicate for each row to determine whether the grid should filter that row out.

## Filtering Tree Rows

Set the `filter` property on the `useTreeDataSource` hook to filter rows created from the
object set on the `data` property of the tree data source.

The `filter` property accepts a predicate function that will be given a property of the object
set on the `data` property. If the function returns `true` the property and any of its children
will be kept, otherwise they will be removed.

The demo below demonstrates this in action. You can click the **Toggle Hidden Files** switch to
show or hide hidden files. A hidden file is considered any file that starts with a `.`, such as
the `.env` file.
