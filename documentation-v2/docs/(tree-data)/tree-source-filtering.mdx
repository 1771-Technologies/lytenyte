## Filtering Tree Rows

Set the `filter` property on the `useTreeDataSource` hook to filter rows created from the
object provided to the `data` property of the tree data source.

The `filter` property accepts a predicate function that receives each value from the object
provided to `data`. If the function returns `true`, the value and any of its children
are kept; otherwise, they are removed.

The demo below demonstrates this behavior. Click the **Toggle Hidden Files** switch to
show or hide hidden files. A hidden file is any file name that starts with a `.`, such as
the `.env` file.
