step: Generate hierarchical rows from nested object data.
description: Pass a nested JavaScript object to the tree data source to create a hierarchical grid layout.

## Data Object

Use the [`useTreeDataSource`](/docs/reference) hook to render a
nested object as a row set. The `data` property must be a JavaScript object.

Configure these functions within the hook:

- **rowValueFn**: Returns the data associated with a specific row.
- **rowChildrenFn**: Returns an array of objects to generate child rows.

The demo below uses objects with custom properties and a `children` key to define the hierarchy.

### Root Rows

Define `rowRootFn` to specify the initial root rows. This is required when
using a wrapper object where the top-level property should not appear as a row.

The following demo uses `rowRootFn` to bypass a `root` property and return
its nested contents as the starting rows.

### Row IDs

LyteNyte Grid requires a unique ID for every row to manage selection,
editing, and React reconciliation.

Define `idFn` to return a custom ID for each row. If omitted, the grid uses
the object's dot-notation path as the default ID. All IDs must be
unique across the entire data set.
