step: Generate hierarchical rows from nested object data.
description: Pass a nested JavaScript object to the tree data source to create a hierarchical grid layout.

## Data Object

Use the [`useTreeDataSource`](/docs/reference) hook to render a
nested object as a row set. The `data` property must be a JavaScript object.

Configure the following functions within the hook to control how
rows are created from the source object:

- **rowValueFn**: Returns the data associated with a specific row.
- **rowChildrenFn**: Returns an array of objects used to generate child rows.

The demo below uses objects with custom properties and a `children` key to define the hierarchy.

::demo[Custom Keys="./demos/basic-keys"]

### Root Rows

Define `rowRootFn` to specify the initial root rows. This function is required when
using a wrapper object where the top-level property should not appear as a row.

The following demo uses `rowRootFn` to bypass a `root` property and return
the nested contents as the starting rows.

::demo[Root Rows="./demos/basic-root"]

In this example, the grid ignores the top-level `root` property in the data.
The `rowRootFn` function returns the `children` property of the `root` object as
an array of entries. Each entry becomes a row, and the grid branches from there.

```ts
const ds = useTreeDataSource({
  data: data,
  rowGroupDefaultExpansion: true,

  //!next 3
  rowRootFn: (x) => {
    return x.children.map((row) => [row.name, row]);
  },
  rowChildrenFn: (x) => {
    if (!x.children) return [];
    return x.children.map((r: any) => [r.name, r]);
  },
  rowValueFn: (x) => ({
    name: x.name,
    kind: x.kind,
    size: x.size || null,
    modified: x.modified,
    lastEditedBy: x.lastEditedBy,
    permissions: x.permissions,
  }),
});
```
