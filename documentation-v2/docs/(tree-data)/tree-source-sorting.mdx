pro: true
step: Sort tree rows in ascending or descending order.
description: Sort tree rows in ascending or descending order by providing a
  single sort function or an array of sort dimensions to the hook.

:::note

Tree data sorting provides the same capabilities as client row sorting.
Review the [Client Row Sorting guide](/docs/client-source-row-sorting) before proceeding.

## Sort Function

In the tree data source, the `sort` function compares two row nodes.
Each node is a [group row node](/docs/reference/row) unless it's pinned.

The demo below shows basic sorting. Click **Sort: Size** to sort
rows by **Size** in descending order.

::demo[Tree Sort Function="./demos/tree-sorting"]

## Sort Dimensions

You can set the `sort` property to an array of [`DimensionSort`](/docs/reference/grid-types) objects. Each
dimension sort uses the [`field`](/docs/column-field) property of a column to compare rows.
A dimension can be applied to sort rows in ascending or descending order.

Since the hook receives an array of `DimensionSort` objects, LyteNyte Grid can perform a multi-way sort.
The tree data source applies the comparators in the order they appear in the provided array,
stopping when a comparator result is not `0`.

The demo below shows dimension sorting. **Click** a column header to sort.
To sort by multiple columns, hold **Control** or **Command** and click additional headers.
