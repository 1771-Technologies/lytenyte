You must already be familiar with client row sorting in LyteNyte Grid before reading
this guide. The tree data source provides identical sort capabilities to the client
row source.

See the [Client Row Sorting guide](/docs/client-source-row-sorting) for
more details.

## Sort Function

A sort function compares two rows of any kind. The tree data source calls the function you pass
to the `sort` property with two row nodes. These row nodes are
[group row nodes](/docs/row-overview), since all row nodes, except pinned row nodes,
are group row nodes.

The demo below shows basic sorting using a sort function. Click the **Sort: Size** button
to sort the rows in descending order by their **Size** value.

## Sort Dimensions

You can set the `sort` property to an array of [`DimensionSort`](/docs/reference/grid-types) objects. Each
dimension sort uses the [`field`](/docs/column-field) property of a column to compare rows.
A dimension can be applied to sort rows in ascending or descending order.

Since the hook receives an array of `DimensionSort` objects, LyteNyte Grid can perform a multi-way sort.
The tree data source applies the comparators in the order they appear in the provided array,
stopping when a comparator result is not `0`.

The demo below demonstrates dimension sorts in action. Click the header of a column to sort by it.
To sort by more than one column, hold the Control or Command key and click an additional column header.
