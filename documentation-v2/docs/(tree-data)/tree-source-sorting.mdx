You must already by familiar with client row sorting in LyteNyte Grid before reading
this guide. The tree data source provides identical sort capabilities to the client
row source.

See the [Client Row Sorting guide](/docs/client-source-row-sorting) for
more details.

## Sort Function

A sort function compares two rows (of any kind). The tree data source calls the function you pass
to the `sort` property with two row nodes. The row nodes will be [group row nodes](/docs/row-overview),
since all the row nodes, except pinned row nodes, are group row nodes.

The demo below shows basic sorting using a sort function. Click the **Sort: Size** button
to sort the rows in descending order by their **Size** value.

## Sort Dimensions

You can set the `sort` property to array of [`DimensionSort`](/docs/reference) object. A dimension
sort will use the [`field`](/docs/column-field) property of a column to compare rows. The dimension
can be applied to sort rows in ascending or descending order.

Since an array of `DimensionSort` objects is supplied, LyteNyte Grid can perform a multi-way sort.
The tree data source will perform comparators in the order they appear in the provided dimension
array, stopping when a comparator result in not `0`.

The demo below demonstrates dimension sorts in action. Click the header of a column to sort on it.
To sort on more than one column, hold the Control/Command key and click a column header.
