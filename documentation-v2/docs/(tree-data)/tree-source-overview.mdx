:::info

LyteNyte Grid expects tree data to be provided as an `object`. If you are coming from
other another data grid, it will have represented tree data as an array of objects with a
path.

Array based hierarchical data is considered a **non-uniform** row grouping in LyteNyte Grid.
See the [Client Row Grouping guide](/docs/client-source-row-grouping) for more details.

Tree data is specifically for handling object based data, such as `JSON` responses from a
server.

:::

## Basic Tree

The `useTreeDataSource` hook may be used to create a LyteNyte Grid data source from an object.
The `useTreeDataSource` hook accepts a plain JavaScript object as its `data` property. By default,
the hook will create a tree from the properties of the object provided, creating a branch whenever the
value of the property is another JavaScript object.
