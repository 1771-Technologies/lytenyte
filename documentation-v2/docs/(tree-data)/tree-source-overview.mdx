:::info

LyteNyte Grid expects tree data to be provided as an `object`. If you are coming from
other another data grid, it will have represented tree data as an array of objects with a
path.

Array based hierarchical data is considered a **non-uniform** row grouping in LyteNyte Grid.
See the [Client Row Grouping guide](/docs/client-source-row-grouping) for more details.

Tree data is specifically for handling object based data, such as `JSON` responses from a
server.

:::

## Basic Tree

The `useTreeDataSource` hook may be used to create a LyteNyte Grid data source from an object.
The `useTreeDataSource` hook accepts a plain JavaScript object as its `data` property, as the
code below shows:

```ts
const data = {
  root: {
    name: "root",
    kind: "folder",
    size: null,
    modified: "2026-01-22T09:00:00Z",
    "package.json": {
      name: "package.json",
      kind: "file",
      size: 1840,
      modified: "2026-01-21T18:12:00Z",
      lastEditedBy: "Joseph Allen",
      permissions: "rw-r--r--",
    },
    "package-lock.json": {
      name: "package-lock.json",
      kind: "file",
      size: 92000,
      modified: "2026-01-21T18:12:30Z",
      lastEditedBy: "Joseph Allen",
      permissions: "rw-r--r--",
    },
  },
};

//!next 4
const ds = useTreeDataSource({
  data: data,
  rowGroupDefaultExpansion: true,
});
```

By default, the `useTreeDataSource` hook will create a tree from the properties of the object provided,
creating a branch whenever the value of the property is another JavaScript object.

The demo below shows the simplest possible tree data view. An object is set on the `data` property.
LyteNyte Grid's tree source creates the tree from the object.

::demo[Basic Tree="./demo/basic-tree"]

Notice in the demo that you still need to define the columns that the grid will use. LyteNyte Grid's
tree source will create rows from the data. Since the data provided always has the potential of branching,
all the rows in the tree source are [group rows](/docs/row-overview).

The remaining guides in this section will cover the full set of tree data capabilities, including configuring
the row data creation process and tree data editing.
