:::info

LyteNyte Grid expects tree data as a nested `object`. Many grids model hierarchies as
arrays with path strings. In LyteNyte Grid, an array with path strings
maps to **non-uniform row grouping, not tree data.**

For array-based hierarchies, see the [Client Row Grouping guide](/docs/client-source-row-grouping).
Use tree data for object-based hierarchies, such as nested `JSON` from a server.

:::

## Basic Tree

The `useTreeDataSource` hook transforms a nested JavaScript object into
a row data source. Assign the object to the `data` property of the `useTreeDataSource` hook.

The example below shows one such configuration:

```ts
const data = {
  root: {
    name: "root",
    kind: "folder",
    size: null,
    modified: "2026-01-22T09:00:00Z",
    "package.json": {
      name: "package.json",
      kind: "file",
      size: 1840,
      modified: "2026-01-21T18:12:00Z",
      lastEditedBy: "Joseph Allen",
      permissions: "rw-r--r--",
    },
    "package-lock.json": {
      name: "package-lock.json",
      kind: "file",
      size: 92000,
      modified: "2026-01-21T18:12:30Z",
      lastEditedBy: "Joseph Allen",
      permissions: "rw-r--r--",
    },
  },
};

const ds = useTreeDataSource({
  data,
  rowGroupDefaultExpansion: true,
});
```

By default, the hook traverses object properties and creates a
branch whenever a property value is itself another object.

The demo below renders a tree from a standard JavaScript object. While the tree data source
generates the rows, you must still define the columns. Since this structure allows
recursion at any level, the data source treats all rows as
[group rows](/docs/row-overview).

The remaining guides in this tree data section cover advanced configurations,
including custom row creation and data editing.
