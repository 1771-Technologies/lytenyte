:::info

LyteNyte Grid requires tree data as a nested `object`. Unlike other grids that
represent hierarchy via arrays with path strings, LyteNyte Grid treats array-based
data as **non-uniform row grouping**.

For array-based structures, see the [Client Row Grouping guide](/docs/client-source-row-grouping).
Tree data specifically targets object-based structures, such as `JSON` server responses.

:::

## Basic Tree

The `useTreeDataSource` hook transforms a nested JavaScript object into
a grid data source. Assign your object to the `data` property. The below
shows one such example:

```ts
const data = {
  root: {
    name: "root",
    kind: "folder",
    size: null,
    modified: "2026-01-22T09:00:00Z",
    "package.json": {
      name: "package.json",
      kind: "file",
      size: 1840,
      modified: "2026-01-21T18:12:00Z",
      lastEditedBy: "Joseph Allen",
      permissions: "rw-r--r--",
    },
    "package-lock.json": {
      name: "package-lock.json",
      kind: "file",
      size: 92000,
      modified: "2026-01-21T18:12:30Z",
      lastEditedBy: "Joseph Allen",
      permissions: "rw-r--r--",
    },
  },
};

const ds = useTreeDataSource({
  data,
  rowGroupDefaultExpansion: true,
});
```

By default, the hook traverses object properties and creates a
branch whenever a property value is another object.

The demo below renders a tree from a standard object. While the tree source generates
the rows, you must still define the columns. Because this structure allows recursion at
any level, the source treats all rows as [group rows](/docs/row-overview).

::demo[Basic Tree="./demos/basic-tree"]

Define columns manually to display the generated row data. Since the source object is
object the tree source treats every row as a [group row](/docs/row-overview), as any node
may contain further children.

The remaining guides in this tree data section will cover advanced configurations,
including custom row creation and data editing.
