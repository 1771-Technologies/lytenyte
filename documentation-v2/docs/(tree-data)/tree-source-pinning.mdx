## Top Pinned Rows

Pin rows to the top of the viewport by assigning an array of
[`RowLeaf`](/docs/reference/row) or [`RowAggregated`](/docs/reference/row)
nodes to the `topData` property of the `useTreeDataSource` hook.

The demo below shows a tree data source with rows pinned to the top.

::demo[Tree Data Top Pinned Rows="./demos/tree-pin-top"]

## Bottom Pinned Rows

Pin rows to the bottom of the viewport by assigning an array of
[`RowLeaf`](/docs/reference/row) or [`RowAggregated`](/docs/reference/row)
nodes to the `botData` property. Rows assigned to `botData` remain fixed at
the bottom edge while the rest of the tree scrolls.

The demo below shows a tree data source with rows pinned to the bottom.
