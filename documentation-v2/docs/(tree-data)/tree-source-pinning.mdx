:::info

Before reading this guide, you must be familiar with row pinning in LyteNyte Grid. Review the
[Row Pinning guide](/docs/row-pinning) for a foundational overview.

:::

## Pinning Rows Top

Assign an array of [`RowLeaf`](/docs/reference/rows) or [`RowAggregated`](/docs/reference/rows) nodes to
the `topData` property of the `useTreeDataSource` hook. This configuration pins the specified
rows to the top of the viewport.

The demo below shows a tree data source with rows frozen at the top.

## Pinning Rows Bottom

To pin rows to the bottom of the viewport, assign an array of [`RowLeaf`](/docs/reference/rows) or
[`RowAggregated`](/docs/reference/rows) nodes to the `botData` property.
Rows assigned to `botData` remain fixed at the bottom edge of the grid while the rest of the
tree content scrolls.

The demo below shows a tree data source with rows frozen at the bottom.
