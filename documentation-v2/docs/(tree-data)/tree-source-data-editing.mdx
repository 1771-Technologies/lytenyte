You must already be familiar with LyteNyte Grid's cell editing capabilities before reading
this guide. Read the [Cell Editing guide](/docs/cell-editing) for more details.

## Editing Tree Cells

To edit a tree cell, make the column for the cell `editable` and provide an `editRenderer`
component. You will also need to set the `editMode` property on the grid to `"cell"` or `"row"`.

When a cell is edited, LyteNyte Grid will call the `onRowDataChange` method of the tree data
source. Set the `onRowDataChange` property on the `useTreeDataSource` hook to handle data
updates.

The `onRowDataChange` change handler will receive the cell changes applied, and any data changes
applied to the rows that are pinned to the top and bottom of the grid. The full function interface
is shown below:

```ts
type OnTreeRowDataChange = (params: {
  readonly changes: { next: object; prev: object; parent: object; key: string }[];
  readonly top: Map<number, T>;
  readonly bottom: Map<number, T>;
}) => void;
```

The demo below demonstrates cell editing in action. You can begin an edit by double clicking
on a cell in the **Size** column.

## Editing The Group Cell

Replace the LyteNyte **Group** column with your own group column to make the group cells
editable. Set the `rowGroupColumn` property on the grid to `false` to prevent LyteNyte Grid
from creating an automatic group column.

Add a new column your definitions that will be a replacement for the automatically generated
group column. Since this column is part of your definitions, you can set the `editable` and
`editRenderer` properties to enable editing.

The demo below demonstrates this by replacing the **Group** column with a new custom column
called **Files**. You can edit the file name by double clicking the cell.

:::note

The data in the demo above is sorted by size, since changing the group name value is equivalent
to changes the branch order when a normal JavaScript object is updated. Sorting by size ensures
rows maintain a stable order.
