:::info

You must already be familiar with LyteNyte Grid's cell editing capabilities before reading
this guide. Read the [Cell Editing guide](/docs/cell-editing) for more details.

## Editing Tree Cells

To edit a tree cell, make the column for that cell `editable` and provide an `editRenderer`
component. You must also set the `editMode` property on the grid to `"cell"` or `"row"`.

When a cell is edited, LyteNyte Grid calls the `onRowDataChange` method on the tree data
source. Set the `onRowDataChange` property on the `useTreeDataSource` hook to handle these
data updates.

The `onRowDataChange` handler receives the applied cell changes, along with any data changes
applied to rows pinned to the top or bottom of the grid. The full function interface is shown
below:

```ts
type OnTreeRowDataChange = (params: {
  readonly changes: { next: object; prev: object; parent: object; key: string; path: string[] }[];
  readonly top: Map<number, T>;
  readonly bottom: Map<number, T>;
}) => void;
```

The demo below demonstrates cell editing in action. You can begin editing by double-clicking
a cell in the **Size** column.

## Editing the Group Cell

Replace the LyteNyte **Group** column with a custom group column to make group cells editable.
Set the `rowGroupColumn` property on the grid to `false` to prevent LyteNyte Grid from creating
an automatic group column.

Add a new column to your column definitions to replace the automatically generated group
column. Since this column is part of your definitions, you can set the `editable` and
`editRenderer` properties to enable editing.

The demo below shows this approach by replacing the **Group** column with a custom column
called **Files**. You can edit the file name by double-clicking the cell.

:::note

The data in the demo above is sorted by size. Changing the group name value is equivalent to
changing the branch order when a standard JavaScript object is updated. Sorting by size
ensures the rows maintain a stable order.
