This guide assumes familiarity with cell editing. Read the [Cell Editing guide](/docs/cell-editing)
for more details.

## Editing Tree Cells

To edit a tree cell, make the column for that cell `editable` and provide an `editRenderer`
component. You must also set the `editMode` property on the grid to `"cell"` or `"row"`.

When a cell is edited, LyteNyte Grid calls the `onRowDataChange` method on the tree data
source. Set the `onRowDataChange` property on the `useTreeDataSource` hook to handle these
data updates.

The `onRowDataChange` handler receives the applied cell changes, along with any data changes
applied to rows pinned to the top or bottom of the grid. The full function interface is shown
below:

```ts
type OnTreeRowDataChange = (params: {
  readonly changes: { next: object; prev: object; parent: object; key: string; path: string[] }[];
  readonly top: Map<number, T>;
  readonly bottom: Map<number, T>;
}) => void;
```

The demo below shows tree cell editing. Double-click a cell in the **Size** column to start editing.

## Editing Tree Groups

To enable group cell editing, replace the LyteNyte **Group** column with
a custom group column. First, set `rowGroupColumn` to `false` to prevent
the grid from creating an automatic group column.

Next, add a custom group column to your definitions.
Since you define this column, set the `editable` and
`editRenderer` properties to enable editing.

The demo below replaces the **Group** column with a custom **Files** column.
Double-click a file name cell to edit it.

:::note

The demo sorts rows by **Size**. Renaming a group can change the branch order when the underlying JavaScript
object is updated. Sorting by **Size** ensures the rows maintain a stable order.
