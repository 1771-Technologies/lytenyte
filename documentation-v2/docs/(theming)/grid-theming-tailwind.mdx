title: Grid Theming With Tailwind
step: Style LyteNyte Grid using Tailwind.
description: Tailwind can be used to style LyteNyte Grid. This guide explains how to set up Tailwind and apply it to grid elements.
---

This guide uses Tailwind as an atomic CSS framework for styling LyteNyte Grid because it is
the most popular option. The approach described here also works with other atomic
CSS frameworks, such as [UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev/).

:::info

We highly recommend reading the general [Grid Theming guide](/docs/grid-theming) first to
understand the styling options available in LyteNyte Grid.

This guide assumes you are using Tailwind v4. Translating
the examples back to Tailwind v3 is straightforward.

:::

## Tailwind Theming Setup

Start by setting up Tailwind. The exact steps depend on your React framework.
See Tailwind's [Installation guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite) for framework-specific details.

This guide assumes you have Tailwind configured with the default setup, and a CSS file that contains:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
```

If you are not sure which framework to use, we recommend starting with
[Vite](https://vite.dev/). The project setup is simple and Tailwind
is supported by an official plugin.

## Applying Tailwind Classes

LyteNyte Grid exposes a set of headless components that you use to build the grid view.
These components accept standard HTML and React props, including `className`.
As a result, styling the grid with Tailwind is as simple as applying utility classes.

The example below demonstrates this using the standard Tailwind color palette:

::demo[Styling With Tailwind="./demos/tailwind-styles"]

In the example, Tailwind classes are applied in the usual way.
No special configuration is required. For example, the `Grid.Cell` component is styled as follows:

```tsx
<Grid.Cell key={c.id} cell={c} className="flex items-center bg-gray-50 px-2 text-sm text-gray-800" />
```

### Class Variance Authority

Directly applying classes to elements works well for simple styling, but it
does not scale when there is a lot of conditional styling being applied.
Tailwind utility helpers can make conditional styles easier to manage. The approach here uses three libraries:

- [`tailwind-merge`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwind-merge)
- [`clsx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clsx)
- [`class-variance-authority`](https://cva.style/docs)

Start by creating a `tw` utility function that combines `clsx` and `tailwind-merge`:

```ts
import type { ClassValue } from "clsx";
import clsx from "clsx";
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge";

export function tw(...c: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(...c));
}
```

:::info

If you already use a Tailwind-based framework such as shadcn/ui, a similar `tw` function
may already exist, often named `cn` in shadcn/ui projects.

:::

Next, define grid-cell variants using `class-variance-authority`:

```ts
const cellStyles = cva("flex items-center px-2", {
  variants: {
    number: {
      true: "justify-end tabular-nums",
    },
    rowBase: {
      true: "border-b border-neutral-200 bg-white text-sm text-neutral-800 group-data-[ln-alternate=true]:bg-neutral-100 dark:border-neutral-800 dark:bg-neutral-900 dark:text-neutral-200 dark:group-data-[ln-alternate=true]:bg-neutral-950",
    },
    header: {
      true: "border-b border-neutral-100 bg-neutral-200 text-sm capitalize text-neutral-900 dark:border-neutral-800 dark:bg-neutral-900 dark:text-neutral-100",
    },
  },
});
```

The `cellStyles` function now returns the base classes and applies
variants on top for different grid-cell states.

The example below shows how to combine Tailwind, `tw`, and `cva` to provide
rich, composable grid styles:

::demo[Tailwind Styling With CVA="./demos/tailwind-cva"]

Notice how the CVA-generated style is applied to the grid cell:

```tsx
<Grid.Cell
  key={cell.id}
  cell={cell}
  className={tw(
    cellStyles({
      number: cell.type === "number",
      rowBase: true,
    }),
  )}
/>
```

This pattern keeps styles consistent and makes it easy to maintain variants over a shared base.

## Styling Elements Not Directly Exposed

The [Grid Theming guide](/docs/grid-theming) explains that some elements
are not directly exposed through LyteNyte Grid's public component interface.
You must style these elements using data attributes or other selectors.

You can still target these elements with Tailwind by using more advanced selector
syntax. This section shows how to style the row-detail element and the cell selection ranges with Tailwind.

### Styling Row Detail

To style the row-detail element with Tailwind, target the element that has the
`data-ln-row-detail` attribute. You can do this without a separate
CSS file by using Tailwind's arbitrary variant selector syntax.

::demo[Tailwind Styling Row Detail="./demos/row-detail-tailwind"]

The selector (shown below) looks complex but it is straightforward. The `&` symbol refers to the current
element. The `[data-ln-row-detail="true"]` portion selects the descendant that has the matching
data attribute. Finally, `>div` selects the `div` that is a direct descendant. If you are
unfamiliar with this syntax, see Tailwind's guide on
[arbitrary variants](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#using-arbitrary-variants).

```tsx
<Grid.Row
  row={row}
  className={tw(
    '**:data-[ln-row-detail="true"]:p-7 [&_[data-ln-row-detail="true"]>div]:rounded-lg',
    '[&_[data-ln-row-detail="true"]>div]:border',
    '[&_[data-ln-row-detail="true"]>div]:border-neutral-200',
    'dark:[&_[data-ln-row-detail="true"]>div]:border-neutral-700',
  )}
/>
```

This example styles the row-detail element inline. You can also move these
styles into a separate CSS file and target the same data attribute selectors there.
Tailwind compiles down to vanilla CSS, so both approaches work.

### Styling Cell Selection Ranges

You can style cell-selection rectangles using arbitrary Tailwind selectors in a similar way.
In this case, you place the selector on the rows container rather than on each row.
The example below demonstrates this:

::demo[Cell Selection Styling With Tailwind="./demos/cell-selection-rect-tailwind"]

Here we use a descendant selector to target every cell selection rectangle.
This is a direct inline approach, but you can also move these rules
to a separate CSS file if you prefer.

```tsx
<Grid.RowsContainer
  className={tw(
    '**:not-data-[ln-cell-selection-is-unit="true"]:data-ln-cell-selection-rect:bg-ln-primary-30 **:data-ln-cell-selection-rect:border-ln-primary-50',
    '**:not-data-[ln-cell-selection-is-unit="true"]:data-[ln-cell-selection-border-top=true]:border-t',
    '**:not-data-[ln-cell-selection-is-unit="true"]:data-[ln-cell-selection-border-bottom=true]:border-b',
    '**:not-data-[ln-cell-selection-is-unit="true"]:data-[ln-cell-selection-border-start=true]:border-l',
    '**:not-data-[ln-cell-selection-is-unit="true"]:data-[ln-cell-selection-border-end=true]:border-r',
    '**:data-[ln-cell-selection-is-unit="true"]:outline **:data-[ln-cell-selection-is-unit="true"]:outline-ln-primary-50 **:data-[ln-cell-selection-is-unit="true"]:-outline-offset-1',
  )}
>
```

## Mixing Tailwind and Pre-built Themes

Fully theming LyteNyte Grid from scratch can require a significant amount of styling.
If you want the grid to match your design system exactly, you may choose to define every
style yourself. However, starting from a pre-built theme and then adjusting
styles with Tailwind is often more efficient.

Because Tailwind does not restrict other CSS inputs, you can combine a pre-built LyteNyte Grid
theme with Tailwind utilities. This is how many of the demos on the 1771 Technologies website
are built. The example below shows Tailwind working alongside the provided grid themes:

::demo[Pre-built Themes With Tailwind="./demos/grid-theming"]

:::warn

Depending on the order of CSS imports in your application, Tailwind styles may override LyteNyte Grid
styles. This happens because the pre-built LyteNyte Grid styles are defined
in the `ln-grid` CSS layer.

To ensure Tailwind and LyteNyte Grid work together as expected, set the layer order in your application
as follows:

```css
@layer base, ln-grid, components, utilities;
```

For more guidance on CSS layers, see
this [MDN guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/At-rules/@layer).

## LyteNyte Tailwind Variants

To make styling LyteNyte Grid with Tailwind easier, the LyteNyte Grid packages export
a Tailwind-specific CSS file with useful variants and Tailwind theme values.
The full content is available on our
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/1771-Technologies/lytenyte/blob/main/packages/lytenyte-core-experimental/css/tw.css).

To use the LyteNyte Grid Tailwind variants, import the file in the same CSS file where you
set up Tailwind:

<Tabs>

<Tab label="Core">

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
@import "@1771technologies/lytenyte-core/tw.css";
```

</Tab>

<Tab label="PRO">

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
@import "@1771technologies/lytenyte-pro/tw.css";
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

After you import it, you can use the custom variants defined in the file. For example,
the `ln-cell` variant sets the cell background in the grid to the value of the
`ln-bg` token.

```tsx
<Grid className="ln-cell:bg-ln-bg" />
```
