title: Grid Theming With Emotion
description: LyteNyte Grid can be styled using Emotion CSS (or any other CSS-in-JS library).
  This guide explains an approach compatible with styled-component style APIs.
---

:::info

Modern React recommends avoiding runtime CSS-in-JS libraries. We include this guide because many codebases
still rely on them. LyteNyte Grid does not assume a specific CSS framework, so a
styled-component approach works as well as a build-time CSS approach.

:::

## Emotion Setup

To start using [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/styled), install the `@emotion/styled` package:

<PackageInstall package="@emotion/styled" />

This package provides Emotion's styled-component API and lets you create pre-styled components:

```tsx
import styled from "@emotion/styled";

const Button = styled.button`
  color: turquoise;
`;
```

We apply this pattern to style LyteNyte Grid components.

## Creating Styled LyteNyte Grid Components

LyteNyte Grid is headless and exposes root primitives you can style individually.
Emotion accepts arbitrary components, and the grid primitives align with Emotion's
API, so creating styled components is straightforward. For example, you can create a styled `Grid.Cell`:

```tsx
const Cell = styled(Grid.Cell)`
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  padding-inline: 8px;
  background-color: light-dark(white, hsla(190, 32%, 6%, 1));
  color: light-dark(hsla(175, 6%, 38%, 1), hsla(175, 10%, 86%, 1));
  font-size: 14px;
  border-bottom: 1px solid light-dark(hsla(175, 20%, 95%, 1), hsla(177, 19%, 17%, 1));
`;
```

Use the `Cell` component in place of `Grid.Cell` when building the grid view.
The following example demonstrates this and also defines a styled header.

## Styling Elements Not Directly Exposed

The [Grid Theming guide](/docs/grid-theming) explains that some elements are not directly exposed through
LyteNyte Grid's public component interface. You must style these elements using data attributes or any
other selector strategy. When using Emotion, you can target these elements with nested
CSS selectors inside a styled wrapper.

### Styling Row Detail

To style the row-detail element, wrap the `Grid.Viewport` or `Grid.RowsContainer` components
in a styled wrapper and target the element with the `data-ln-row-detail` attribute.
The example below shows this approach.

::demo[Emotion Styling Row Detail="./demos/row-detail-emotion"]

Here is the styled wrapper used to target the row-detail container:

```tsx
const RowsContainer = styled(Grid.RowsContainer)`
  & [data-ln-row-detail="true"] {
    padding: 24px;
  }

  & [data-ln-row-detail="true"] > div {
    border: 1px solid gray;
    border-radius: 8px;
    background-color: light-dark(white, transparent);
  }
`;
```

### Styling Cell Selection Ranges

Cell-selection rectangles can also be styled using a nested data-attribute
selector within a styled wrapper. The example below demonstrates this:

::demo[Cell Selection Styling With Emotion="./demos/cell-selection-rect-emotion"]

Here is the styled wrapper that targets the cell-selection rectangle:

```tsx
const RowsContainer = styled(Grid.RowsContainer)`
  & [data-ln-cell-selection-rect]:not([data-ln-cell-selection-is-unit="true"]) {
    background-color: var(--lng1771-primary-30);
    box-sizing: border-box;

    &[data-ln-cell-selection-border-top="true"] {
      border-top: 1px solid var(--lng1771-primary-50);
    }
    &[data-ln-cell-selection-border-bottom="true"] {
      border-bottom: 1px solid var(--lng1771-primary-50);
    }
    &[data-ln-cell-selection-border-start="true"] {
      border-inline-start: 1px solid var(--lng1771-primary-50);
    }
    &[data-ln-cell-selection-border-end="true"] {
      border-inline-end: 1px solid var(--lng1771-primary-50);
    }
  }
  & [data-ln-cell-selection-rect][data-ln-cell-selection-is-unit="true"] {
    outline: 1px solid var(--lng1771-primary-50);
    outline-offset: -1px;
  }
`;
```

## Emotion And Pre-built Themes

LyteNyte Grid provides pre-styled themes implemented in plain CSS. These themes work with
any CSS framework, including Emotion. You can include a pre-built theme in your
application and layer Emotion-based styles on top. The example below demonstrates this:
