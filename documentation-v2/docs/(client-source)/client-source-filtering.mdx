title: Client Row Filtering
step: Explore how to filter rows when using the client row source.
description: LyteNyte Grid's client row source lets you to set custom filters to exclude specific rows
  from view. These filtered rows are omitted before actions such as grouping, sorting, or aggregating are executed.

:::info

This guide offers an overview of filters, focusing on the client row source properties.
For detailed guidance on Filtering, refer to our Filtering Section,
beginning with the [Filter Text guide](/docs/filtering-text).

## Filter Property

The `filter` property on the client row source accepts a filter predicate or an
array of filter predicates. A filter predicate is a function that receives a
leaf row and returns `true` if the grid should keep the row or `false` if the
grid should filter the row out.

A basic filter function is shown below. Click the **Mastercard** button to
view only Mastercard payments, or the **Visa** button to view only Visa payments.

::demo[Client Row Filter Function="./demos/client-filtering"]

The demo creates a filter function that is passed to the client source,
as shown below. This minimal approach supports any filter model, since
filtering is an arbitrary predicate function.

```tsx
//!next
const [filter, setFilter] = useState<Grid.T.FilterFn<GridSpec["data"]> | null>(null);

const ds = useClientDataSource<GridSpec>({ data: data, filter }); //!

// Later in the code

<button
  onClick={() => {
    setFilter(
      //!next
      () => (row: Grid.T.RowLeaf<GridSpec["data"]>) => row.data.paymentMethod === "Mastercard",
    );
  }}
>
```

### Filter Array

Providing a single filter function is cumbersome when filters originate from different sources.
For example, if you support per-column text search, you can write one filter function
per column and pass those column filter functions to `useClientDataSource`.

## Filter Leaf Rows

Filter callbacks passed via the `filter` property receive **leaf rows only**
because filtering runs **before** grouping or aggregation.
Apply filters to raw rows, not grouped or aggregated output.

For post-grouping filtering in the client source, see
the [Client Row Having Filter guide](/docs/client-source-having-filters).
