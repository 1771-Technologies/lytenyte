title: Client Row Filtering
step: Explore how to filter rows when using the client row source.
description: LyteNyte Grid's client row source lets you set custom filters to exclude rows from
  the view. The grid excludes filtered rows before performing actions such as grouping,
  sorting, or aggregating.

:::note

This guide covers filters at a high level, with a particular focus on the properties
of the client row source. See the guides in the **Filtering** section of the
LyteNyte Grid documentation for more thorough guidance on creating filters for the grid.
A good place to start is the [Filtering Text guide](/docs/filtering-text).

:::

## The Filter Property

The `filter` property on the client row source accepts a filter predicate or an
array of filter predicates. A filter predicate is a function that receives a
leaf row and returns `true` if the grid should keep the row or `false` if the
grid should filter the row out.

The demo below demonstrates a basic filter function. Click the **Mastercard** button
to show only those rows that have Mastercard as a payment method. Similarly, click the
**Visa** button to show only those rows that have Visa as a payment method.

::demo[Filter Function="./demos/client-filtering"]

The demo creates a filter function and passes it to the client source as shown in the
code below. This is a minimal approach. However, since filtering is a function,
you can represent any filter model.

```tsx
//!next
const [filter, setFilter] = useState<Grid.T.FilterFn<GridSpec["data"]> | null>(null);

const ds = useClientDataSource<GridSpec>({ data: data, filter }); //!

// Later in the code

<button
  onClick={() => {
    setFilter(
      //!next
      () => (row: Grid.T.RowLeaf<GridSpec["data"]>) => row.data.paymentMethod === "Mastercard",
    );
  }}
>
```

### Filter Array

Providing a single filter function can be awkward when filters come from multiple places.

For example, your application could implement basic
text searching on a per-column basis. It is much easier to create a filter function
for each column and provide these functions to the `useClientDataSource` hook.

## Filters Apply To Leaf Rows

The functions you provide through the `filter` property receive leaf rows only. This is because
filters apply before grouping or aggregation. Keep this in mind when you apply filters to your
data.

See the [Client Row Having Filter guide](/docs/client-source-having-filters) for
post-grouping filter capabilities of the client source.
