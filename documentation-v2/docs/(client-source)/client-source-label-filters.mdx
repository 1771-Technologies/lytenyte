Label filters are specialized filters that are used only when row
grouping is enabled on the client row source. For additional details on row grouping,
refer to the [Client Row Grouping guide](/docs/client-source-row-grouping).

## Label Filter Function

The LyteNyte Grid client data source accepts an array of `LabelFilter` functions or
null values. The array index maps to a group depth: element
`n` is applied at depth `n`. If an element is `null`, the client data
source skips label filtering at that depth.

The demo shows label filters in action. Click a pill to exclude that label from
the grid. Each pill row maps to a group level:

- The **Job pill row** filters job groups.
- The **Education pill row** filters education groups.

The demo below shows label filters in action. Clicking a pill disables that label in the grid.
The pills are arranged in rows to represent the grouping level. For example, the **Job** pills filter
labels in the job grouping, and the **Education** pills filter labels in the education grouping.

::demo[Row Label Filters="./demos/client-row-label-filters"]

The demo scans pills to identify inactive items. For each grouping level that includes
inactive pills, it creates label filters to remove rows with those labels.
This is shown in the code below.

For more on pill manager functionality, see the [Pill Manager guide](/docs/component-pill-manager).

```ts
const labelFilter = useMemo(() => {
  const filters: (Grid.T.LabelFilter | null)[] = [];

  for (const pillRow of pills) {
    const inactive = new Set(pillRow.pills.filter((x) => !x.active).map((x) => x.id));
    if (inactive.size === 0) {
      filters.push(null);
      continue;
    } else {
      filters.push((s) => !inactive.has(s as string));
    }
  }

  return filters;
}, [pills]);
```
