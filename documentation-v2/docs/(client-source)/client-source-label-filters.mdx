title: Client Row Label Filters
pro: true
step: Use Row Label Filters to show only row groups with valid grouping labels.
description: Row Label Filters are a special type of filter that excludes rows
  with specific row grouping labels. Use these filters when you want
  to display only row groups with valid labels.

Label filters are specialized filters that are only used when row grouping is enabled
on the client row source. For more on row grouping, see the
[Client Row Grouping guide](/docs/client-source-row-grouping).

## Label Filter Function

The LyteNyte Grid client data source accepts an array of `LabelFilter` functions or `null` values. Label filters
always apply at a specific group depth. Each index in the array represents the group depth that the label filter
applies to. When the filter value at a particular index is `null`, the client data source skips label filtering
for that depth.

The demo below shows label filters in action. Clicking a pill disables that label in the grid.
The pills are arranged in rows to represent the grouping level. For example, the **Job** pills filter
labels in the job grouping, and the **Education** pills filter labels in the education grouping.

::demo[Label Filters="./demos/client-row-label-filters"]

To create the label filters, the demo scans the pills and finds any inactive items. For each grouping level
that has inactive pills, the demo creates a label filter that removes group rows with those labels. The code
below shows this. For more on the pill manager functionality, see the
[Pill Manager guide](/docs/component-pill-manager).

```ts
const labelFilter = useMemo(() => {
  const filters: (Grid.T.LabelFilter | null)[] = [];

  for (const pillRow of pills) {
    const inactive = new Set(pillRow.pills.filter((x) => !x.active).map((x) => x.id));
    if (inactive.size === 0) {
      filters.push(null);
      continue;
    } else {
      filters.push((s) => !inactive.has(s as string));
    }
  }

  return filters;
}, [pills]);
```
