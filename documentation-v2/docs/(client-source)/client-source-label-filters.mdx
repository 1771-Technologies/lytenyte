Label filters are specialized filters that will only be used when there are row groups
applied to the client row source. For more on row grouping see the
[Client Row Grouping guide](/docs/client-source-row-grouping).

## Label Filter Function

The LyteNyte Grid client data source accepts an array of `LabelFilter` functions or null. Label filters
are always applied at a specific depth level for row groups. Each index in the array represents the
depth that the label filter will be applied to. When the filter value at a particular index is `null`,
the label filter for that depth is skipped.

The demo below shows label filters in action.
