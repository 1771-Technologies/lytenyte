title: Client Row Pinning
step: Pin rows to the top or bottom of the grid's viewport.
description: Create rows that are pinned to the top or bottom of the grid's
  viewport. Pinned rows remain visible as the user scrolls the grid.

:::info

For a high-level overview of pinned rows, see the [Row Pinning guide](/docs/row-pinning).
This guide covers row pinning specifically when using the client row source.

## Pinning Rows Top

To pin rows to the top of the grid, set the `topData` property on the client row data source.
The demo below pins two rows to the top of the viewport. Notice that these rows remain visible
as you scroll.

## Pinning Rows Bottom

To pin rows to the bottom of the grid, set the `botData` property on the client row data source.
The demo below pins two rows to the bottom of the viewport. These rows remain fixed to the bottom
of the viewport even as you scroll.

::demo[Bottom Pinned Rows="./demos/client-bot-rows"]

## Pinning Rows Top & Bottom

You can pin rows to both the top and bottom of the viewport by setting both `topData` and `botData`
at the same time. Since pinned rows always remain visible, you must ensure the grid's viewport has
enough height to display them.

## Pinned Row Considerations

The client data source treats pinned rows as separate from the row data provided via the
`data` property. In particular:

- Pinned rows will never be filtered out
- Sorting rows will not sort pinned rows
- Pinned rows cannot be used for groups
