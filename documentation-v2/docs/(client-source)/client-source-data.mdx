title: Client Row Data
step: See how to manage client row data in LyteNyte Grid.
description: Client row data is an array of rows that is fully available on the client.
  This guide covers key considerations when working with client-side row data.

## The Data Property

Use the `data` property on the `useClientDataSource` hook to provide the raw data the client
data source uses to create rows. The example below demonstrates the basic setup.

::demo[Client Data="./demos/client-overview"]

## Updating Data

LyteNyte Grid's `useClientDataSource` derives the view from the `data` you provide. This means that
changes to the `data` value you pass to the hook will update the rows in the grid.

The `useClientDataSource` hook intelligently updates row nodes when the row data changes. Only
data items that have changed result in new row nodes being created. This makes it possible
to update the row data efficiently by passing a new data array with some items updated.

The demo below demonstrates direct data updates. The data ticks every second and randomly updates
some rows in the view.

::demo[Data Updates="./demos/client-data-update"]

To create the ticking data, the demo stores the `data` in React state, then calls `setData`
in an interval every second with a new data set, as shown below.

```ts
export default function ClientDataDemo() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(initialData); //!
  const ds = useClientDataSource({ data: data });

  //!next 7
  useEffect(() => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      setData((prev) => tickDexData(prev));
    }, 1000);

    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

  // Component
}
```

Since LyteNyte Grid intelligently updates rows, this approach to updating data scales
quite well. LyteNyte Grid can handle more than 10,000 updates per second, even in complex
setups that include filtering and grouping. However, you should still optimize your
row data updates, since frequent updates can result in unnecessary work.
Follow these tips:

- Perform **delta** updates to your row data, if possible. Instead of creating new references
  for each row in an array, reuse the items that have not changed. This allows LyteNyte Grid
  to identify only the items that have changed and create new row nodes for them.
- Batch updates to your row data. LyteNyte Grid can handle updates on a millisecond
  level. However, humans can't keep track of values that change so frequently. Batching updates to
  your row data into intervals of a few hundred milliseconds to a few seconds is an easy optimization to make
  that yields major performance gains.
