title: Client Row Data
step: Learn how to manage client row data in LyteNyte Grid.
description: Client row data is an array of rows fully loaded in the browser.
  This guide outlines the key considerations for working with client row data.

## Data Property

Use the `data` property in the `useClientDataSource` hook to provide the
raw data for creating rows in the client data source.
The example below shows a basic configuration.

::demo[Client Data Setup="./demos/client-overview"]

## Updating Data

LyteNyte Grid's `useClientDataSource` derives the view from the `data` you provide. This means that
changes to the `data` value you pass to the hook will update the rows in the grid.

`useClientDataSource` updates row nodes when the data changes and creates
new nodes only for rows that changed. Update efficiently by passing a new
data array that keeps unchanged rows and replaces only the modified ones.

The demo below shows direct data updates. Every second,
it randomly updates a subset of visible rows.

::demo[Direct Data Updates="./demos/client-data-update"]

To create the ticking data, the demo stores the `data` in React state and updates it every
second by calling `setData` with a new data set, as shown below.

```ts
export default function ClientDataDemo() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(initialData); //!
  const ds = useClientDataSource({ data: data });

  //!next 7
  useEffect(() => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      setData((prev) => tickDexData(prev));
    }, 1000);

    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

  // Component
}
```

LyteNyte Grid updates only the changed rows, making it highly efficient for
large-scale data updates. In testing, the grid handles over 10,000 updates
per second, even with filtering and grouping enabled. Still, you should optimize
row updates. Frequent updates can trigger unnecessary work. Consider these tips:

- **Perform Delta Updates:** If possible, reuse unchanged row objects in your
  data array instead of creating new object references for every row.
  This lets LyteNyte Grid detect which rows changed and create new row
  nodes only for those rows.

- **Batch Update Row Data:** LyteNyte Grid can handle updates with millisecond-level
  precision, imperceptible to humans. Batching updates to your row data into intervals
  of 200 milliseconds to a few seconds reduces render churn and improves performance.
