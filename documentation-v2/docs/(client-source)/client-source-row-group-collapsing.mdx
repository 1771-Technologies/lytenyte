title: Client Row Group Collapsing
pro: true
step: Flatten single-child group rows.
description: Row grouping transforms row data into a tree structure. LyteNyte Grid flattens this
  tree if a row group contains only a single leaf child.
---

To collapse group rows that contain a single child row automatically,
set `rowGroupCollapseBehavior` on the client data source to one of the following values:

- **"full-tree":** Collapse group rows with a single child at every depth.
- **"last-only":** Collapse group rows with a single child only at the final depth level.
- **"no-collapse":** Do not collapse any group rows. This is the default.

## Full Tree Collapsing

Setting `rowGroupCollapseBehavior` to `"full-tree"` collapses group rows that have a
single child at every depth level. Use the `"full-tree"` setting when you want a grouping tree that
is as flat as possible without losing information.

::demo[Full Tree Collapsing="./demos/client-row-grouping-collapsing"]

:::note

To clearly demonstrate the `"full-tree"` collapse behavior, the sample data includes only
a single row for the **Blue-Collar** job category.

:::

## Last Only Collapsing

Setting `rowGroupCollapseBehavior` to `"last-only"` collapses only the final group row
when it has a single child. Unlike `"full-tree"`, the client data source does not collapse parent groups
after collapsing the final group, as the demo below shows.

::demo[Last Row Group Collapsing="./demos/client-row-grouping-collapse-last"]

In the demo, the **Blue-Collar** group has a single child. However, because the grid uses
two grouping levels, only the last level is collapsed.

## Updating Collapse Settings

You can update `rowGroupCollapseBehavior` dynamically. In this demo,
`useState` manages the property value, which updates via
a toggle group to demonstrate the different behaviors.
