title: Client Row Group Collapsing
pro: true
step: Flatten single-child group rows.
description: Row grouping creates a tree representation of your row data. LyteNyte Grid
  can collapse and flatten this tree when a group row has only a single leaf child.
---

When you group rows in the grid, some groups will have only a single child row.
You can instruct the client data source to collapse row groups by setting the
`rowGroupCollapseBehavior`, which accepts one of three values:

- `"full-tree"`: Group rows with a single child are collapsed at every depth level.
- `"last-only"`: Only collapse group rows at the final depth level, and collapse each matching group once.
- `"no-collapse"`: The client data source does not collapse any row groups. This is the default setting.

## Full Tree Collapsing

Setting `rowGroupCollapseBehavior` to `"full-tree"` collapses group rows that have a
single child at every depth level. Use the `"full-tree"` setting when you want a grouping tree that
is as flat as possible without losing information.

::demo[Full Tree Collapsing="./demos/client-row-grouping-collapsing"]

:::note

To clearly demonstrate the `"full-tree"` collapse behavior, the sample data includes only
a single row for the **Unemployed** job category.

:::

## Last Only Collapsing

Setting `rowGroupCollapseBehavior` to `"last-only"` collapses only the final group row
when it has a single child. Unlike `"full-tree"`, the client data source does not collapse parent groups
after collapsing the final group, as the demo below shows.

::demo[Last Row Group Collapsing="./demos/client-row-grouping-collapse-last"]

In the demo, the **Unemployed** group has a single child. However, because the grid uses two grouping levels,
only the last level is collapsed.

## Collapse Setting Update

You can update `rowGroupCollapseBehavior` at any time. In the demo below, you can
switch between collapse behaviors to see them in action. To support this, the demo stores the
collapse behavior in React state using `useState` and updates the value through a toggle group.
