title: Client Row Deleting
step: Delete rows and sync changes to client data.
description: Delete rows using LyteNyte Grid's row data source and propagate the deletion to your client data.
---

The `useClientDataSource` hook returns a row source that can delete rows by calling the
`rowDelete` method. When you provide the source to the grid, the `rowDelete` method becomes
part of the grid's API.

You can use the `rowDelete` method to remove existing rows from your data. You can remove any row at
any index. To handle row deletions, provide the `useClientDataSource` hook with a callback on the
`onRowsDeleted` property.

## Deleting Rows

In the demo below, click the **trash icon** to delete a row from the grid. When you delete a row,
the grid calls the `onRowsDeleted` callback you provided to `useClientDataSource`. The client data
source passes two values to `onRowsDeleted`: the rows to delete, and the source indices for those rows.

:::info

A **source index** is the array index in the original data used to create the row node. A source index
is not the same as a **row index**, because the row index can change based on the grid's sort, grouping,
and filter state, whilst a source index is a stable lookup to the original row data.

::demo[Deleting Rows="./demos/client-row-deleting"]

The demo deletes rows using the code below. Notice that the code creates a new array by calling
`filter`. You may think you could simplify this by using `splice` to delete a row. However, `splice`
changes the indices of the existing array, which invalidates the **source indices** passed to
`onRowsDeleted`. In this case, `filter` is a better choice.

```ts
setData((prev) => {
  const next = prev.filter((_, i) => !params.sourceIndices.includes(i));
  return next;
});
```
